# Mini Fate

A slimmed-down hybrid of Fate Core and Fate Accelerated, powered by skills and aspects.

## Project Status

We're rebooting after some time away!
Live iteration in `_chapters`.
Previous work has been demoted to `_loose-notes`.

## Bookkeeping

This repo is set up as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.
It can be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (though we haven't got that set up yet).
