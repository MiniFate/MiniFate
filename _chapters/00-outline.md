# Introduction

Robin Hood is a beloved outlaw, skilled with both sword and bow.
He leads a band of Merry Men against the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.
He's loyal to King Richard in the face of the usurper Prince John.
And he's in love with Maid Marian.
With just those few sentences, we're ready to tell a story.
Everything else --- where he's from, what he carries, and the state of the world --- can wait until it becomes important.

{GameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

The core mechanic of {GameName} is Aspects: short improvised phrases about the in-game world.

## Game Materials

{GameName} doesn't require a lot to get started: just pens to write with, paper to record your character on, a set of four Fate dice, and some tokens to represent _Fate Points_.

Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice marked with {{pos}} on two sides, {{zero}} on two sides, and {{neg}} on two sides.
To keep things moving quickly, it's best to have a set of four dice for each player rather than passing them back and forth.
If you don't have specially marked Fate dice, you can use a normal six-side die and treat 1 and 2 as <span class="nowrap">{{neg}},</span> 3 and 4 as <span class="nowrap">{{zero}},</span> and 5 and 6 as <span class="nowrap">{{pos}}.</span>

You'll also need a way to keep track of fate points.
The best way is to have something physical to pass back and forth---poker chips are excellent for this---but you can track them by just making a mark on your character sheet as well.
In a pinch, you could even use polyhedral dice since you won't otherwise need them in {GameName}.

# Getting Started

Not 100% sure about where to introduce aspects, but I think the flow here makes sense:

- OK, want to get started? Great! Here we go!
- The most important thing is aspects! They power everything.
- You use aspects to build your world.
- You use aspects to build your character.

## Core Concept: Aspects

## World Building

## Character Creation

do this as a character sheet walkthrough
discuss concept and trouble, since you set those right away
declare the rest (stress, consequences, refresh?) but define them later

## Non-Player Characters

Like a PC, but can have as many aspects as you want (or as few) and at whatever numbers you want.
Mobs.

# How to Play

## Setting the Scene

## Rolling the Dice

## Fate Points

Compel and invoke

# Conflicts

Pretty much the same as roleplaying, but:
- Different pacing due to lots of rolls
- Map, optionally, depending on the situation
- Worrying about stress and consequences

Note: "conflict" is pretty broad.
It can be anything where the party is up against opponents
It can be a negotiation.
It can be a race.
It can be anything where these mechanics feel right.

## Stress and Consequences

you get a fate point for taking a consequence?
recovery fits here too

## Drawing a Map

Probably the top priority section for diagrams!

# Appendix

## Mages, Mechs, and Mercs

How to do weird stuff.
Aspect-based narration.
Skills were actually the thing that made this weird.
With just aspects, you can roll for whatever makes sense

## Character Advancement

Add a new aspect after every story arc.
Bump the rest up.
Linear, not pyramid.
Unclear if this is a core rule or not
