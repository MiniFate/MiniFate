# Introduction

Robin Hood is a beloved outlaw, skilled with both sword and bow.
He leads a band of Merry Men against the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.
He's loyal to King Richard in the face of the usurper Prince John.
And he's in love with Maid Marian.
With just those few sentences, we're ready to tell a story.
Everything else --- where he's from, what he carries, and the state of the world --- can wait until it becomes important.

{GameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

The core mechanic of {GameName} is Aspects: short improvised phrases about the in-game world.

## Game Materials

{GameName} doesn't require a lot to get started:
just pens to write with,
paper to record your character on,
a set of four Fate dice,
and some tokens to represent Fate Points.

Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice.
They are marked with {{pos}} on two sides, {{zero}} on two sides, and {{neg}} on two sides.
To keep things moving quickly, it's best to have a set of four dice for each player.
If you don't have specially marked Fate dice, you can use normal six-side dice as follows:

| D6 Roll  | Fate Roll |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| 1 or 2   | {{neg}}   |
| 3 or 4   | {{zero}}  |
| 5 or 6   | {{pos}}   |

You'll also need a way to keep track of fate points for each player. 
Poker chips are perfect for this, but in a pinch you can just mark them down with pencil and paper.

# Getting Started

Not 100% sure about where to introduce aspects, but I think the flow here makes sense:

- OK, want to get started? Great! Here we go!
- The most important thing is aspects! They power everything.
- You use aspects to build your world.
- You use aspects to build your character.

## Core Concept: Aspects

## World Building

<!--
QUESTION:
I keep saying game, setting, world.
Do we want one word for these? World aspects? Setting aspects?
-->

A game's setting helps players understand how their characters fit into the world.
Aspects make sure everyone is on the same page.


The setting is {GameName} is given aspects just like everything else narratively important.
Start with two aspects to describe the world: a genre and a conflict.
The genre aspect gives a sense of what, when, and where the story takes place.
The conflict aspect introduces the who and the why of the setting's biggest source of dramatic tension.

Write the aspects down somewhere everyone can see them.
Don't worry about making them perfect as they're just a starting point.
As the story progresses the setting may change; when this happens feel free to add or modify setting aspects.

> Our players know they want to play a "steampunk Robin Hood" game, but that means something different to each of them.
> They start out with the genre aspect ~~Kind Outlaws in Steampunk England~~ but each player still has a different idea of what that means.
> To {A}, that means a swashbuckling adventure where bandits thumb their noses at the lecherous sheriff.
> {B} is picturing something gritty; soldiers return from a holy war to find that England no longer feels like home.
> {C} doesn't much care about the setting, as long as she can play as a wizard.
> And {D}, thinking back to the childhood movie, is looking forward to the talking animals.
> After some more discussion about the setting they would like to play in they settle on:
> ~~Weary soldiers return to find a steam a magic revolution has changed England~~
>
> TODO: ~~Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor isn't as easy as it sounds~~
> ~~Rich vs poor doesn't matter when there is magic~~
> ~~Something something sheriff~~

## Character Creation

Player characters (PCs) are mechanically simple but narratively diverse.
To start each PC has two aspects: their concept and their trouble.

A PC's concept aspect answers the question "Who are you playing?"
It describes what makes the PC a unique, exciting character.
Some example concepts are:
~~Rightful King Hiding in the Wild~~,
~~Loner Hacker Who Knows The World Is Not What It Seems~~,
or ~~Backwater Farm Boy Looking to Join The Academy~~.

A PC's trouble aspect describes the sort of things that get in the PC's way and make their story interesting.
It does not need to be the most likely thing to cause the PC trouble.
It is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of problems they would find interesting to deal with.

Some example troubles are:
~~I Don't Know Which Side I'm On~~,
~~Everyone I Get Close To Ends Up In Trouble~~,
or ~~My Past Is A Dangerous Mystery, Even to Me~~.

Neither PC aspect is entirely good or entirely bad.
The PC's concept could harm them from time-to-time while their trouble might actually help in certain circumstances.
Look for opportunities to interpret a PC's aspects in a way that gives the PC depth or makes the game more exciting.

## Non-Player Characters

Like a PC, but can have as many aspects as you want (or as few) and at whatever numbers you want.
Mobs.

# How to Play

## Setting the Scene

## Rolling the Dice

## Fate Points

Compel and invoke

# Conflicts

Pretty much the same as roleplaying, but:
- Different pacing due to lots of rolls
- Map, optionally, depending on the situation
- Worrying about stress and consequences

Note: "conflict" is pretty broad.
It can be anything where the party is up against opponents
It can be a negotiation.
It can be a race.
It can be anything where these mechanics feel right.

## Stress and Consequences

you get a fate point for taking a consequence?
recovery fits here too

## Drawing a Map

Probably the top priority section for diagrams!

# Appendix

## Mages, Mechs, and Mercs

How to do weird stuff.
Aspect-based narration.
Skills were actually the thing that made this weird.
With just aspects, you can roll for whatever makes sense

## Character Advancement

Add a new aspect after every story arc.
Bump the rest up.
Linear, not pyramid.
Unclear if this is a core rule or not
