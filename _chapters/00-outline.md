# Introduction

Robin Hood is a beloved outlaw, skilled with both sword and bow.
He leads a band of Merry Men against the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.
He's loyal to King Richard in the face of the usurper Prince John.
And he's in love with Maid Marian.
With just those few sentences, we're ready to tell a story.
Everything else --- where he's from, what he carries, when the story is set --- can wait until it becomes important.

{gameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

The core mechanic of {gameName} is Aspects: short improvised phrases about the in-game world.

# Your First Session

It's ok to spend a whole evening figuring out what kind of game you want to play.
You're still doing creative and fun things!

## Core Concept: Aspects

could alternatively see this in the intro?
definitely want to hit it in a dedicated section, rather than tack it onto world building or character creation

## Genre & Conflict

## Character Creation

do this as a character sheet walkthrough
discuss concept and trouble, since you set those right away
declare the rest (stress, consequences, refresh?) but define them later

## Non-Player Characters

# How To Play

## Setting the Scene

## Rolls, Stress, and Consequences

I think this is two sections.
It's too much to be one due to combat.
Not sure yet how to break it up though.

## Compels and Invocations

# Advanced Rules

Other possible names for this chapter:
- Tips & Tricks
- Optional Rules
- Appendix

## Character Advancement

Add a new aspect after every story arc.
Bump the rest up.
Linear, not pyramid.

## Combat with a Map

## Mages, Mechs, and Mercs

How to do weird stuff.
Aspect-based narration.
Skills were actually the thing that made this weird.
With just aspects, you can roll for whatever makes sense
