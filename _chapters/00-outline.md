# Introduction

Robin Hood is a beloved outlaw, skilled with both sword and bow.
He leads a band of Merry Men against the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.
He's loyal to the absent King Richard in the face of the usurper Prince John.
And he's in love with Maid Marian.
With just those few sentences, we're ready to tell a story.
Everything else --- where he's from, what he carries, and the state of the world --- can wait until it becomes important.

{GameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

---

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs.
They may tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization.
Or it could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into deep space in search of a new home.
It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs build influence through secrets and scandals.

## Who You Need

To play {GameName}, you need one GM (game master) and at least two players.
Each player takes on the role of a PC (player character).
The GM is responsible for the world around the PCs, including its cast of NPCs (non-player characters).

The GM and PCs are not opponents, even though the PCs and NPCs will often be enemies.
Play is collaborative.
Everyone at the table has the same goal: telling a good story and having a good time.

## What You Need

{GameName} requires a few things to get started:
pens to write with,
paper to record your character on,
a set of four Fate dice,
and some tokens to represent Fate Points.

Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice.
They are marked with {{pos}} on two sides, {{zero}} on two sides, and {{neg}} on two sides.
To keep things moving quickly, it's best to have a set of four dice for each player.
If you don't have specially marked Fate dice, you can use normal six-side dice as follows:

| D6 Roll  | Fate Roll |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| 1 or 2   | {{neg}}   |
| 3 or 4   | {{zero}}  |
| 5 or 6   | {{pos}}   |

You'll also need a way to keep track of fate points for each player.
Poker chips are perfect for this, but in a pinch you can just mark them down with pencil.

# Getting Started

Before your first session, the group decides they want their game to be "steampunk Robin Hood".
As it turns out, that can mean a bunch of different things. <!-- lose this line? -->
To {A}, that means a swashbuckling adventure where bandits thumb their noses at the lecherous sheriff.
{B} is picturing something gritty; soldiers return from a holy war to find that England no longer feels like home. <!-- is dystopian steampunk allowed? or is steampunk supposed to be optimistic? -->
{C} doesn't much care about the setting, as long as she can play as a wizard.
And {D}, thinking back to the childhood movie, is looking forward to the talking animals.

<!-- passive voice or not? probably go through and make this consistent at the end -->
Before starting the game, everyone needs to be on the same page.
{GameName} provides a powerful tool for that: aspects.

## Core Concept: Aspects

At face value, an aspect is just a short phrase written down for the whole table to see.

- aspects are short improvised phrases. can be about anything: people, places, things, relationships, scenes, overall setting.
- aspects are true. otherwise, rewrite it or get rid of it.
- aspects keep everyone on the same page about what's important. the focus of the scene. like lighting or music or director's notes in a movie. depending on the framing, TODO FOOBAR can be tense or sad or sexy.
- aspects provide scaffolding for building out the story/world. introduce things that you can come back to later: people, places, relationships, technologies. `Hunted by the Sheriff of Nottingham`, `Disheartened Veteran of the Tenth Crusade` `something flying boat something`
- aspects provide bonuses on rolls. there's a chapter about that later. probably do NOT introduce fate points here.
- writing good aspects. you can lean on inside jokes and pop culture.

## World Building

In {GameName}, setting creation and character creation happen together.
It is good to have a rough idea of what type of game the players and GM want to play, but ultimately settings are defined by their characters and vice versa.
A `Pirate Captain Who Hates Violence` in a world where `Magic is Suddenly Real` is very different than one on the `Blood Drenched Sands of the Caribbean`.

The game creation process should be collaborative, so it is often best to set aside the first game session in order to design the setting and the PCs together.
A good way to structure world building is to come up with a broad definition of the setting and then build the PCs.
This lets you use character creation to define the details of the world.

## Setting Creation

The setting is {GameName} is given aspects just like everything else important to the narrative.
Start with two aspects to describe the world: a genre and a conflict.
The genre aspect gives a sense of what, when, and where the story takes place.
The conflict aspect introduces the who and the why of the setting's biggest source of dramatic tension.

Write the aspects down somewhere everyone can see them, but don't worry about making them perfect as they're just a starting point.
As the story progresses the setting may change; when this happens feel free to add or modify setting aspects.

> Our players want to be sky pirates in a steampunk fantasy world where they can use magic, have sword fights, and swagger around getting into and out of trouble.
> They discuss a bit and then write down a genre aspect:
>
> {:.key-def}
> |    Genre: | `Steam-Powered Swashbuckling above the Seven Seas` |
>
> The players aren't exactly sure what conflicts would be exciting, but they know they want intrigue and suspense, where they can never be sure if they're the conman or the mark.
> They write the conflict aspect:
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Conflict: | `A Puppet-Master is Pulling All the Strings` |

Once you're happy with your setting, it's time to build the characters that will inhabit it.

## Character Creation

Player characters (PCs) are mechanically simple but narratively diverse.
To start each PC has two aspects: their concept and their trouble.

Your PC's concept aspect answers the question "Who are you playing?"
It describes what makes the PC a unique, exciting character.
A character's concept alongside the setting aspects should give a good idea of who they are and how they'll play.
Some example concepts are:
`Rightful King Hiding in the Wild`,
`Loner Hacker Who Knows The World Is Not What It Seems`,
or `Backwater Farm Boy Looking to Join The Academy`.

Your PC's trouble aspect describes the sort of things that get in the PC's way and gives them depth.
The trouble aspect is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of problems they would find interesting to deal with.

The trouble aspect should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to cause the PC trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in game.
A hardboiled detective might drink excessively, but `Can't Resist a Drink` might not add much roleplaying potential, whereas `Soft Spot for Losers Like Me` offers the GM and other players a lot of story hooks.

Some example troubles are:
`I Don't Know Which Side I'm On`,
`Everyone I Get Close To Ends Up In Trouble`,
or `My Past Is A Dangerous Mystery, Even to Me`.

Neither character aspect is entirely good or entirely bad.
The PC's concept could harm them from time-to-time while their trouble might actually help in certain circumstances.
Look for opportunities to interpret a PC's aspects in a way that gives the PC depth or makes the game more exciting.

> It is time to put together our pirate PCs. The first is Tor Byorn Yorgensen:
>
> A year ago, Tor Byorn Yorgensen had it all: a fast ship, a loyal crew, and a fearsome reputation.
> He once stole the emperor's summer fashion shipment from a privateer without spilling a single drop of blood.
> But he lost everything in a night of drunken gambling.
> Now, disgraced, he serves as second mate on the ramshackle _Angry Pig_.
> He still keeps his axe close, ready to defend his new crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Speak Softly and Carry a Magic Axe` |
> | Trouble: | `Lost My Boat in a Game of Cards`    |
>
> The second PC is Naka:
>
> Captain Naka is a half-orc pyromancer (and pyromaniac) exiled by her magic-fearing clan.
> She grew up on the streets of Three Bridges, where her quick tongue and speedy reflexes kept her safe from the worst consequences of her own actions.
> A loner with trust issues, she now finds herself conflicted by her responsibility for _Angry Pig_ and its crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Never Met A Problem My Magic Couldn't Ignite` |
> | Trouble: | `Old Habits, New Responcibilities`            |

In {GameName}, characters have some mechanical "crunch" in addition to their aspects.
Aspects are given ratings that help their character perform actions.
The Concept aspect is rated at +2 and the Trouble aspect is rated at +1.
Additionally, characters have a refresh rate of two and three consequences.
More details on how these mechanics work will be discussed in the section on performing actions.

## Non-Player Characters

NPCs are the characters in the story that bring the world to life.
They are created and played by the GM.
NPCs include everyone from background characters at a pirate bar, to marauding goblins attacking a small village, to the general of the empire's army who is more than he seems.

NPCs are more free-form than PCs.
The GM should use whatever components---aspects, refresh, consequences---the NPCs needs to fulfill their role in the narrative.
For example, background NPCs may only need a name.
NPCs intended to act as a minor obstacle, such as guards trying to keep the PCs out of the king's ball, need only a single aspect about their motivation.
Recurring NPCs can have a few aspects with appropriate values.
If an NPC becomes unexpectedly important, you can add an aspect or two to flesh out their story on the fly.

The GM can even bundle multiple NPCs together on the same character sheet!
An unruly mob can be represented as a single NPC with the aspect `Torches and Pitchforks`.
This helps keep bookkeeping manageable, even as the PCs interact with a large number of NPCs.

# How to Play

The story in {GameName} plays out scene-by-scene.
The GM generally opens each scene with a quick description.
Play proceeds conversationally from there as the players and GM improvise back and forth.
Players speak as their PCs and describe their actions, while the GM narrates how the world responds.
Players may also ask the GM for further details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

PC choices are made by the players, while the success of PC actions is judged by dice.
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with.
The dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true.
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses, while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs in a way that feels true to them.

## Rolling the Dice

The GM may prompt players to roll at any time.

Sometimes you roll because your PC is attempting to do something.
- Naka throwing a fireball
- TBY bluffing at cards

Sometimes the GM prompts you to roll unexpectedly.
- An ambush!
- Notice that the new guy has cards up his sleeve.
- We need to include something about "Don't roll 'spot' and then go 'I guess you don't see anything'", failure of a roll leads to immediate consequences.

Rolling the dice isn't about difficulty.
- Roll when either outcome feels like it would be interesting.
- It's ok to suspend disbelief for the sake of theatricality.
- Example of difficult but boring stuff...
- Example of easy stuff where failure is interesting...

## Fate Points

TBY's trouble tells us that he plays cards.
Maybe he's bad, and a degenerate gambler?
Maybe he's great, but got cheated?
Tagging the aspect allows us to flesh out that part of the story.

Compel and invoke

# Conflicts

Most of the gameplay in {GameName} consists of roleplaying, with occasional dice rolls to determine the path the story takes.
However, there are times when the PCs are acting in opposition to something or someone.
These situations are where you use conflicts.

A conflict is any situation where the PCs are up against opponents.
This can include battles with mythical creatures or other enemies,
negotiations to broker a peace treaty between warring factions,
or even a race against time to see if the PCs can get to the capital ahead of their rival's army.

<!-- TODO: Do we still have turns? -->

Pretty much the same as roleplaying, but:
- Different pacing due to lots of rolls
- Map, optionally, depending on the situation
- Worrying about stress and consequences

## Stress and Consequences

<!-- TODO: Are all aspects rated? And you invoke them you get the bonus??! -->
PCs have three Consequence aspects, with ratings of +1, +2, +3.
These aspects start the game blank and are filled in by the player when their PC is harmed by something, like a rival NPC or even the environment.
Consequence aspects allow players to choose how their PCs are affected by failures, providing a sense of control over their character's story.

NPCs can have different number and ratings of Consequence aspects.
For example, a very challenging NPC might have several low-rating Consequence aspects to allow them to withstand a lot of harm.
On the other hand, a weak NPC might only have a single Consequence aspect, allowing them to be knocked out with a single good blow.
The number and rating of Consequence aspects for NPCs is determined by the GM as appropriate for the specific NPC and the situation.

If a character fills in all of their Consequence aspects, they are removed from the current conflict.
This does not mean the character is "dead"---many classic stories have the hero or villain appear to meet their end only to show up at an critical moment.
But it does mean the character takes no more actions for the rest of the scene.

<!-- TODO: Really?
How does this next part work in practice?
Gotta get a fate point right because the GM is narrating your character! -->
The player can shape what happens to their PC by writing down their final Consequence aspect.
The GM uses this aspect to craft the narrative.
The player is given a Fate Point when their character is taken out, because losing narrative control is a Compel.
 
<!-- TODO:
Recovery fits here too
-->

## Drawing a Map

<!-- TODO: Diagrams -->

In general the exact location of characters does not matter, but there are times when it is critical, such as during a sword fight.
In these cases, maps can be used to keep track of characters' positions and movements.
Maps are not highly detailed, instead they are broken up into broad Zones.
This allows players and the GM to quickly and easily understand the layout of the space without getting bogged down in unnecessary details.

Characters in the same zone can interact with each other and any object in the zone.
However, they need permission from one of their aspects to interact with things outside the zone.
A character may move to an adjacent zone on their turn in addition to their action.

Zones can also have aspects, which may restrict free movement or visibility between zones. 
Consider what makes sense from a narrative perspective when deciding whether a character can move or act over a zone boundary.

> The _Angry Pig_ is circling a mountain outpost exchanging cannon fire after a failed attempt to bypass the Empire's northern border.
> There are three zones on the board: The _Angry Pig_, the sky, and the outpost.
> The sky has the aspect `A Very Long Way Down`.
>
> Tor Byorn is stuck on the _Angry Pig_, unable to bring his axe to bear on the canons poking holes in his ship since the sky's aspect indicates that he can't cross the zone.
> Tor Byorn's player decides the Dwarf has had enough enough and roles `Agility` to create the aspect `Flying Leap` which gives him the ability to cross the intervening zones.
> If the Dwarf's rolls succeeds, his aspect will allow him to jump the gap between the ship and outpost, if he rolls poorly...
> Well, it is a very long way down.

# Appendix

How to do weird stuff.
Aspect-based narration.
Skills were actually the thing that made this weird.
