# Introduction

TODO: you don't care about what's in Robin Hood's backpack. You don't care about the cooldown timer when Thor calls down lightning. That's not what the story is about. Be in the moment. Let everything else slide.

{GameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

---

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs.
They may tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization.
Or it could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into deep space in search of a new home.
It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs build influence through secrets and scandals.

## Who You Need

To play {GameName}, you need one GM (game master) and at least two players.
Each player takes on the role of a PC (player character).
The GM is responsible for the world around the PCs, including its cast of NPCs (non-player characters).

The GM and PCs are not opponents, even though the PCs and NPCs will often be enemies.
Play is collaborative.
Everyone at the table has the same goal: telling a good story and having a good time.

## What You Need

{GameName} requires a few things to get started:
pens to write with,
paper to record your character on,
a set of four Fate dice,
and some tokens to represent Fate Points.

Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice.
They are marked with {{pos}} on two sides, {{zero}} on two sides, and {{neg}} on two sides.
To keep things moving quickly, it's best to have a set of four dice for each player.
If you don't have specially marked Fate dice, you can use normal six-side dice as follows:

| D6 Roll  | Fate Roll |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| 1 or 2   | {{neg}}   |
| 3 or 4   | {{zero}}  |
| 5 or 6   | {{pos}}   |

You'll also need a way to keep track of fate points for each player.
Poker chips are perfect for this, but in a pinch you can just mark them down with pencil.

# Getting Started

Before you can tell a story, you need a setting and some characters.

- This is a collaborative process. The whole table works together.
- Come in with a general idea then riff off each other. 
  You can bounce back and forth between setting and aspects. 
  More art than science.
- A `Pirate Captain Who Hates Violence` in a world where `Magic is Suddenly Real` is very different than one on the `Blood Drenched Sands of the Caribbean`.
- It can take a while.
  Nice to set aside the whole first session to figure out the setting and characters. 
  Also gives you time to percolate before the story starts.
- Characters and setting are both defined by aspects (see next section).

## Core Concept: Aspects

At face value, an aspect is just a short phrase written down for the whole table to see.

- aspects are short improvised phrases. can be about anything: people, places, things, relationships, scenes, overall setting.
- aspects are true. otherwise, rewrite it or get rid of it.
- aspects keep everyone on the same page about what's important. the focus of the scene. like lighting or music or director's notes in a movie. depending on the framing, TODO FOOBAR can be tense or sad or sexy.
- aspects provide scaffolding for building out the story/world. introduce things that you can come back to later: people, places, relationships, technologies. `Hunted by the Sheriff of Nottingham`, `Disheartened Veteran of the Tenth Crusade` `something flying boat something`
- aspects provide bonuses on rolls. there's a chapter about that later. probably do NOT introduce fate points here.
- writing good aspects. you can lean on inside jokes and pop culture.

## Setting Creation

Your setting is defined by two aspects: a Genre and a Conflict.
The Genre aspect gives a sense of what, when, and where the story takes place.
The Conflict aspect is the source of dramatic tension.

Write the aspects down somewhere everyone can see them, but don't worry about making them perfect.
They're just a starting point.
You can update them as the story unfolds.

> Alex wants to play a swashbuckling pirate.
> Barry wants to play a streetwise wizard.
> After a bit of haggling, they settle on something that works for them both:
>
> {:.key-def}
> |    Genre: | `Swagger and Sorcery on the Seven Seas` |
>
> The conflict is trickier.
> They're not exactly looking for a hack-and-slash treasure hunt.
> They want a bit of suspense and intrigue.
> Planning out the whole conspiracy on the first day would spoil the fun, so instead they plant an ominous clue to get them started:
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Conflict: | `The Pirate King has Vanished Without a Trace` |

TODO: and just like that the players have created a new part of the world. There is a Pirate king, and he's gone missing. (But better writing)

## Character Creation

Player characters (PCs) are mechanically simple but narratively diverse.
To start each PC has two aspects: their concept and their trouble.

Your PC's concept aspect answers the question "Who are you playing?"
It describes what makes the PC a unique, exciting character.
A character's concept alongside the setting aspects should give a good idea of who they are and how they'll play.
Some example concepts are:
`Rightful King Hiding in the Wild`,
`Loner Hacker Who Knows The World Is Not What It Seems`,
or `Backwater Farm Boy Looking to Join The Academy`.

Your PC's trouble aspect describes the sort of things that get in the PC's way and gives them depth.
The trouble aspect is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of problems they would find interesting to deal with.

The trouble aspect should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to cause the PC trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in game.
A hardboiled detective might drink excessively, but `Can't Resist a Drink` might not add much roleplaying potential, whereas `Soft Spot for Losers Like Me` offers the GM and other players a lot of story hooks.

Some example troubles are:
`I Don't Know Which Side I'm On`,
`Everyone I Get Close To Ends Up In Trouble`,
or `My Past Is A Dangerous Mystery, Even to Me`.

Neither character aspect is entirely good or entirely bad.
The PC's concept could harm them from time-to-time while their trouble might actually help in certain circumstances.
Look for opportunities to interpret a PC's aspects in a way that gives the PC depth or makes the game more exciting.

> It is time to put together our pirate PCs. The first is Tor Byorn Yorgensen:
>
> A year ago, Tor Byorn Yorgensen had it all: a fast ship, a loyal crew, and a fearsome reputation.
> He once stole the emperor's summer fashion shipment from a privateer without spilling a single drop of blood.
> But he lost everything in a night of drunken gambling.
> Now, disgraced, he serves as second mate on the ramshackle _Angry Pig_.
> He still keeps his axe close, ready to defend his new crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Speak Softly and Carry a Magic Axe` |
> | Trouble: | `Lost My Boat in a Game of Cards`    |
>
> The second PC is Naka:
>
> Captain Naka is a half-orc pyromancer (and pyromaniac) exiled by her magic-fearing clan.
> She grew up on the streets of Three Bridges, where her quick tongue and speedy reflexes kept her safe from the worst consequences of her own actions.
> A loner with trust issues, she now finds herself conflicted by her responsibility for _Angry Pig_ and its crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Never Met A Problem My Magic Couldn't Ignite` |
> | Trouble: | `Old Habits, New Responsibilities`            |

In {GameName}, characters have some mechanical "crunch" in addition to their aspects.
Aspects are given ratings that help their character perform actions.
The Concept aspect is rated at +2 and the Trouble aspect is rated at +1.
Additionally, characters have a refresh rate of two and three consequences.
More details on how these mechanics work will be discussed in the section on performing actions.

## Non-Player Characters

NPCs are the characters in the story that bring the world to life.
They are created and played by the GM.
NPCs include everyone from background characters at a pirate bar, to marauding goblins attacking a small village, to the general of the empire's army who is more than he seems.

NPCs are more free-form than PCs.
The GM should use whatever components---aspects, refresh, consequences---the character needs to fulfill their role in the narrative.
For example, background characters may only need a name.
Characters intended to act as a minor obstacle, such as guards trying to keep the characters out of the king's ball, need only a single aspect about their motivation.
Recurring characters can have a few aspects with appropriate values.
If a character suddenly becomes more important, you can add aspects as needed to give them more narrative weight which develops the character and their story organically.

The GM can even bundle multiple characters together on the same character sheet!
An unruly mob can be represented as a single NPC with the aspect Torches and Pitchforks.
This allows the players to interact with the characters without needing to manage a large number of individual NPCs.

# How to Play

The story in {GameName} plays out scene-by-scene.
The GM generally opens each scene with a quick description.
Play proceeds conversationally from there as the players and GM improvise back and forth.
Players speak as their PCs and describe their actions, while the GM narrates how the world responds.
Players may also ask the GM for further details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

PC choices are made by the players, while the success of PC actions is judged by dice.
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with.
The dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true.
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses, while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs in a way that feels true to them.

## Rolling the Dice

The GM may prompt players to roll at any time.

Sometimes you roll because your PC is attempting to do something.
- Naka throwing a fireball
- TBY bluffing at cards

Sometimes the GM prompts you to roll unexpectedly.
- An ambush!
- Notice that the new guy has cards up his sleeve.
- We need to include something about "Don't roll 'spot' and then go 'I guess you don't see anything'", failure of a roll leads to immediate consequences.

Rolling the dice isn't about difficulty.
- Roll when either outcome feels like it would be interesting.
- It's ok to suspend disbelief for the sake of theatricality.
- Example of difficult but boring stuff...
- Example of easy stuff where failure is interesting...

## Fate Points

At the beginning of each session, each player gets two fate points.

Fate points can be spent to invoke an aspect.
- Bonus on a roll that makes sense in light of an aspect

Fate points are earned by accepting compels.
- Complication that makes sense in light of an aspect
- Typically suggested by the GM
- Often (but not always) related to a PC's trouble

Players can also spend a fate point to assert a new aspect
- Compelling the GM
- Often related to a PC's past
- I've been here before
- That's my old boat

TBY's trouble tells us that he plays cards.
Maybe he's bad, and a degenerate gambler?
Maybe he's great, but got cheated?
Tagging the aspect allows us to flesh out that part of the story.

# Conflicts

Pretty much the same as roleplaying, but:
- Different pacing due to lots of rolls
- Map, optionally, depending on the situation
- Worrying about stress and consequences

Note: "conflict" is pretty broad.
It can be anything where the party is up against opponents
It can be a negotiation.
It can be a race.
It can be anything where these mechanics feel right.

## Stress and Consequences

you get a fate point for taking a consequence?
recovery fits here too

## Drawing a Map

Probably the top priority section for diagrams!

# Appendix

## Mages, Mechs, and Mercs

How to do weird stuff.
Aspect-based narration.
Skills were actually the thing that made this weird.
With just aspects, you can roll for whatever makes sense

## Character Advancement

Add a new aspect after every story arc.
Bump the rest up.
Linear, not pyramid.
Unclear if this is a core rule or not
