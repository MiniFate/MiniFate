# Introduction

TODO: you don't care about what's in Robin Hood's backpack. You don't care about the cooldown timer when Thor calls down lightning. That's not what the story is about. Be in the moment. Let everything else slide.

{GameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

---

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs.
They may tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization.
Or it could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into deep space in search of a new home.
It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs build influence through secrets and scandals.

## Who You Need

To play {GameName}, you need one GM (game master) and at least two players.
Each player takes on the role of a PC (player character).
The GM is responsible for the world around the PCs, including its cast of NPCs (non-player characters).

The GM and PCs are not opponents, even though the PCs and NPCs will often be enemies.
Play is collaborative.
Everyone at the table has the same goal: telling a good story and having a good time.

## What You Need

{GameName} requires a few things to get started:
pens to write with,
paper to record your character on,
a set of four Fate dice,
and some tokens to represent Fate Points.

Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice.
They are marked with {{pos}} on two sides, {{zero}} on two sides, and {{neg}} on two sides.
To keep things moving quickly, it's best to have a set of four dice for each player.
If you don't have specially marked Fate dice, you can use normal six-side dice as follows:

| D6 Roll  | Fate Roll |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| 1 or 2   | {{neg}}   |
| 3 or 4   | {{zero}}  |
| 5 or 6   | {{pos}}   |

You'll also need a way to keep track of fate points for each player.
Poker chips are perfect for this, but in a pinch you can just mark them down with pencil.

# Getting Started

Before you can tell a story, you need a setting and some characters.

- This is a collaborative process. The whole table works together.
- Come in with a general idea then riff off each other. 
  You can bounce back and forth between setting and aspects. 
  More art than science.
- A `Pirate Captain Who Hates Violence` in a world where `Magic is Suddenly Real` is very different than one on the `Blood Drenched Sands of the Caribbean`.
- It can take a while.
  Nice to set aside the whole first session to figure out the setting and characters. 
  Also gives you time to percolate before the story starts.
- Characters and setting are both defined by aspects (see next section).

## Core Concept: Aspects

At face value, an aspect is just a short phrase written down for the whole table to see.

- aspects are short improvised phrases. can be about anything: people, places, things, relationships, scenes, overall setting.
- aspects are true. otherwise, rewrite it or get rid of it.
- aspects keep everyone on the same page about what's important. the focus of the scene. like lighting or music or director's notes in a movie. depending on the framing, TODO FOOBAR can be tense or sad or sexy.
- aspects provide scaffolding for building out the story/world. introduce things that you can come back to later: people, places, relationships, technologies. `Hunted by the Sheriff of Nottingham`, `Disheartened Veteran of the Tenth Crusade` `something flying boat something`
- aspects provide bonuses on rolls. there's a chapter about that later. probably do NOT introduce fate points here.
- writing good aspects. you can lean on inside jokes and pop culture.

## Setting Creation

Your setting is defined by two aspects: a Genre and a Conflict.
The Genre aspect gives a sense of what, when, and where the story takes place.
The Conflict aspect is the source of dramatic tension.

Write the aspects down somewhere everyone can see them, but don't worry about making them perfect.
They're just a starting point.
You can update them as the story unfolds.

> Alex wants to play a swashbuckling pirate.
> Barry wants to play a streetwise wizard.
> After a bit of haggling, they settle on something that works for them both:
>
> {:.key-def}
> |    Genre: | `Swagger and Sorcery on the Seven Seas` |
>
> The conflict is trickier.
> They're not exactly looking for a hack-and-slash treasure hunt.
> They want a bit of suspense and intrigue.
> Planning out the whole conspiracy on the first day would spoil the fun, so instead they plant an ominous clue to get them started:
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Conflict: | `The Pirate King has Vanished Without a Trace` |

TODO: and just like that the players have created a new part of the world. There is a Pirate king, and he's gone missing. (But better writing)

## Character Creation

Player characters (PCs) are mechanically simple but narratively diverse.
To start each PC has two aspects: their concept and their trouble.

Your PC's concept aspect answers the question "Who are you playing?"
It describes what makes the PC a unique, exciting character.
A character's concept alongside the setting aspects should give a good idea of who they are and how they'll play.
Some example concepts are:
`Rightful King Hiding in the Wild`,
`Loner Hacker Who Knows The World Is Not What It Seems`,
or `Backwater Farm Boy Looking to Join The Academy`.

Your PC's trouble aspect describes the sort of things that get in the PC's way and gives them depth.
The trouble aspect is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of problems they would find interesting to deal with.

The trouble aspect should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to cause the PC trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in game.
A hardboiled detective might drink excessively, but `Can't Resist a Drink` might not add much roleplaying potential, whereas `Soft Spot for Losers Like Me` offers the GM and other players a lot of story hooks.

Some example troubles are:
`I Don't Know Which Side I'm On`,
`Everyone I Get Close To Ends Up In Trouble`,
or `My Past Is A Dangerous Mystery, Even to Me`.

Neither character aspect is entirely good or entirely bad.
The PC's concept could harm them from time-to-time while their trouble might actually help in certain circumstances.
Look for opportunities to interpret a PC's aspects in a way that gives the PC depth or makes the game more exciting.

> It is time to put together our pirate PCs. The first is Tor Byorn Yorgensen:
>
> A year ago, Tor Byorn Yorgensen had it all: a fast ship, a loyal crew, and a fearsome reputation.
> He once stole the emperor's summer fashion shipment from a privateer without spilling a single drop of blood.
> But he lost everything in a night of drunken gambling.
> Now, disgraced, he serves as second mate on the ramshackle {BoatName}.
> He still keeps his axe close, ready to defend his new crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Speak Softly and Carry a Magic Axe` |
> | Trouble: | `Lost My Boat in a Game of Cards`    |
>
> The second PC is Naka:
>
> Captain Naka is a half-orc pyromancer (and pyromaniac) exiled by her magic-fearing clan.
> She grew up on the streets of Three Bridges, where her quick tongue and speedy reflexes kept her safe from the worst consequences of her own actions.
> A loner with trust issues, she now finds herself conflicted by her responsibility for {BoatName} and its crew.
>
> {:.key-def}
> | Concept: | `Never Met A Problem My Magic Couldn't Ignite` |
> | Trouble: | `Old Habits, New Responsibilities`            |

Each PC also has a space for a third aspect, called a Consequence.
Leave this one blank for now.
It'll get filled in during conflicts.

```
do PCs gain aspects as they level up? Probably yes, so tweak above wording
```

In {GameName}, characters have some mechanical "crunch" in addition to their aspects.

```
refresh. Is this a property of the character or does everyone just get two?
```

```
PCs also have three stress boxes. Or maybe just two? These are used to soak up damage during conflicts (see ...)
```

## Non-Player Characters

NPCs are the characters in the story that bring the world to life.
They are created and played by the GM.
NPCs include everyone from background characters at a pirate bar, to marauding goblins attacking a small village, to the general of the empire's army who is more than he seems.

NPCs are more free-form than PCs.
The GM should use whatever components---aspects, refresh, consequences---the NPCs needs to fulfill their role in the narrative.
For example, background NPCs may only need a name.
NPCs intended to act as a minor obstacle, such as guards trying to keep the PCs out of the king's ball, need only a single aspect about their motivation.
Recurring NPCs can have a few aspects with appropriate values.
If an NPC becomes unexpectedly important, you can add an aspect or two to flesh out their story on the fly.

```
Is the mob an NPC, or is each character within the mob an NPC? Need to make sure we are consistent.
```

The GM can even bundle multiple NPCs together on the same character sheet!
An unruly mob can be represented as a single NPC with the aspect `Torches and Pitchforks`.
This helps keep bookkeeping manageable, even as the PCs interact with a large number of NPCs.

NPCs generally have one stress box per aspect.
However, the GM may want to add a few extra boxes if they're using a single character sheet to represent a group of NPCs.

# How to Play

The story in {GameName} plays out scene-by-scene.
The GM generally opens each scene with a quick description.
Play proceeds conversationally from there as the players and GM improvise back and forth.
Players speak as their PCs and describe their actions, while the GM narrates how the world responds.
Players may also ask the GM for further details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

PC choices are made by the players, while the success of PC actions is judged by dice.
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with.
The dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true.
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses, while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs in a way that feels true to them.

## Rolling the Dice

Dice are an important part of {GameName} because they add surprise and excitement to the story, but that doesn't mean you need to roll for every little thing.
As a general rule, the GM should prompt players for a roll in situations where a competent hero might reasonably fail _and_ failure adds an interesting twist to the story.
For example, a `Swashbuckling Genius` probably doesn't need to roll to fend off an attack by a `Nameless Deck-Hand`...
but she might roll to subdue him before his friends escape, or to recognize him as a `Student of the Blade Dancers`.

TODO: make this pretty

```
- The GM sets a target number for the roll. This is public. Don't roll until the target is set. 
- TODO: does the GM pull a target out of their ass? Do they (like players) start from zero and invoke aspects? Do bigger baddies just start with more fate points?
- TODO: Does the GM always roll, even when there is no opposing NPC? I think yes, for a consistent probability distribution
- When prompted, roll four dice and add them up per the table
- You may also invoke aspects for bonuses. More on that below
- If you have multiple free invokes on the same aspect, can you burn them all at once?
```

| Die Face  | Value |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| {{neg}}   | -1    |
| {{zero}}  | 0     |
| {{pos}}   | +1    |

If the player's roll (plus bonuses) matches or beats the target number, the player succeeds. 
Success means the player gets to do one of the following:

- Create a scene aspect with a free invocation (usually just write a checkbox next to the aspect)
- Add an additional free invocation to an existing scene aspect
- Modify a scene aspect and add an additional free invocation (yuck we are talking about this a lot considering it's not defined yet)
- Remove a scene aspect (any remaining free invocations are lost) 
- Check a stress box on an opposing PC or NPC. If they have no boxes left, they're out of the scene. 

As with everything in {GameName}, the bottom line is it has to make sense with the story.
If TBY is rolling to bluff at cards, it probably doesn't make sense to check a stress box on the bartender or create a scene aspect `Building On Fire`.

Knocking a character out of the scene means just that: they don't get to do anything else until the scene is over.
It's less about hurting the character and more about moving the story forward.

- In a fight, it can mean they're killed. Or it can mean they're knocked unconscious, or they lose their nerve and flee, or they get jostled off the boat, etc. 
- In a drinking contest, they're passed out or puking
- In a game of cards, they're out of chips

If a player succeeds by 3 (?) or more, they double the effect.
The two effects need not be the same.
For example, options incllude:

- Create a scene aspect with two free invocations
- Add a free invocation to an existing scene aspect and check a stress box on an opposing NPC
- Modify `foo` to `bar`, adding a free invocation to it, and remove `baz`

If the player's roll falls short of the target, the results are the same, but it's the GM that chooses. 

Rather than getting knocked out of the scene, a PC can take a consequence.
This can only happen once (until it clears at the end of the story arc, see X).
If you get hit again, you're out, and you keep the consequence.

```
can big bad NPCs take consequences?
```

Every roll has an immediate outcome.
You never fail silently.
But sometimes you might fail in a way that you don't yet understand.
Example? TBY is keeping watch. GM asks for a roll. No good. GM creates the aspect `Sawing Logs` to suggest that TBY has fallen asleep at his post

### Creating An Aspect

Sometimes the aspects describing a scene aren't the ones you want.
Your character can create new aspects or destroy existing ones with a role.
To do so, the player states their intention and the GM sets a difficulty from 0 (easy) to 6 (hard).
The player rolls their dice, sums the result, and adds any appropriate character aspect value (0 if none of their aspects fit the situation).
If this total meets or beats the GM's difficulty, they succeed.
When creating an aspect, the player gets one free invocation using the aspect; they get an additional invocation if they succeed with style.

<!-- TODO: Add drawing of card/whiteboard with aspect, innvocation.
Probably as a play example. -->

<!-- TODO: Define invocation -->

The GM may prompt players to roll at any time.

Sometimes you roll because your PC is attempting to do something.
- Naka throwing a fireball
- TBY bluffing at cards

Sometimes the GM prompts you to roll unexpectedly.
- An ambush!
- Notice that the new guy has cards up his sleeve.
- We need to include something about "Don't roll 'spot' and then go 'I guess you don't see anything'", failure of a roll leads to immediate consequences.

Rolling the dice isn't about difficulty.
- Roll when either outcome feels like it would be interesting.
- It's ok to suspend disbelief for the sake of theatricality.
- Example of difficult but boring stuff...
- Example of easy stuff where failure is interesting...

## Fate Points

At the beginning of each session, each player gets two fate points.

Fate points can be spent to invoke an aspect.
- Bonus on a roll that makes sense in light of an aspect

Fate points are earned by accepting compels.
- Complication that makes sense in light of an aspect
- Typically suggested by the GM
- Often (but not always) related to a PC's trouble

Players can also spend a fate point to assert a new aspect
- Compelling the GM
- Often related to a PC's past
- I've been here before
- That's my old boat

TBY's trouble tells us that he plays cards.
Maybe he's bad, and a degenerate gambler?
Maybe he's great, but got cheated?
Tagging the aspect allows us to flesh out that part of the story.

# Conflicts

<!-- TODO: Reword --> 
Most of the gameplay in {GameName} is conversational, with occasional dice rolls to determine the path the story takes.
But sometimes you will need to role a lot of dice; that is when you turn to conflicts.

A conflict is any situation where the PCs are up against opponents.
This can include battles with mythical creatures or other enemies,
negotiations to broker a peace treaty between warring factions,
or even a race against time to see if the PCs can get to the capital ahead of their rival's army.

```
Do we still have turns?
```

Pretty much the same as roleplaying, but:
- Different pacing due to lots of rolls
- Map, optionally, depending on the situation
- Worrying about stress and consequences

## Stress and Consequences

```
Are all aspects rated? And you invoke them you get the bonus??!
```

PCs have three Consequence aspects.
These aspects start the game blank and are filled in by the player when their PC is harmed by something, like a rival NPC or even the environment.
Consequence aspects allow players to choose how their PCs are affected by failures, providing a sense of control over their character's story.

NPCs can have different number of Consequence aspects.
For example, a very challenging NPC might have several Consequence aspects to allow them to withstand a lot of harm.

```
How does this all work?
```

On the other hand, a weak NPC might only have a single Consequence aspect, allowing them to be knocked out with a single good blow.
The number of Consequence aspects for NPCs is determined by the GM as appropriate for the specific NPC and the situation.

If a character fills in all of their Consequence aspects, they are removed from the current conflict.
This does not mean the character is "dead"---many classic stories have the hero or villain appear to meet their end only to show up at an critical moment.
But it does mean the character takes no more actions for the rest of the scene.

```
Really?
How does this next part work in practice?
Gotta get a fate point right because the GM is narrating your character!
```

The player can shape what happens to their PC by writing down their final Consequence aspect.
The GM uses this aspect to craft the narrative.
The player is given a Fate Point when their character is taken out, because losing narrative control is a Compel.
 
```
Recovery fits here too
```

## Drawing a Map

<!-- TODO: Diagrams -->

In a fight, you need to know who's within arm's reach, who's within a few paces, and who's within sight.
{GameName} handles that with zones.
Draw each zone on a map with as much or as little detail as needed.

Characters in the same zone can interact with each other and any object in the zone.
However, they need permission from one of their aspects to interact with things outside the zone.
A character may move to an adjacent zone on their turn in addition to their action.

Zones can also have aspects, which may restrict free movement or visibility between zones. 
Consider what makes sense from a narrative perspective when deciding whether a character can move or act over a zone boundary.

> The {BoatName} is circling a mountain outpost exchanging cannon fire after a failed attempt to bypass the Empire's northern border.
> There are three zones on the board: The {BoatName}, the sky, and the outpost.
> The sky has the aspect `A Very Long Way Down`.
> <figure class="map">
>   <img
      src="images/boat_and_tower_map.svg"
      alt="A map showing a roughly boat shapped object on the left labeled '{BoatName}'. On the boat is drawn a cirlce labeled 'Tor Byorn'. On the right side is a rounded square labeled 'Outpost'. Between the boat and the outpost are the text 'Sky' and the aspect 'A very long way down' written under it in a smaller font."
    />
>   <figcaption>The map sketched by the GM, showing the three zones, the aspect for the Sky, and Tor Byorn's position.</figcaption>
> </figure>
>
> Tor Byorn is stuck on the {BoatName}, unable to bring his axe to bear on the canons poking holes in his ship since the sky's aspect indicates that he can't cross the zone.
> Tor Byorn's player decides the Dwarf has had enough enough.
> He roles to create the aspect `Flying Leap` which would give him the ability to cross the intervening zones.
> If the Dwarf's rolls succeeds, his aspect will allow him to jump the gap between the ship and outpost, if he rolls poorly...
> Well, it is `A Very Long Way Down`.
