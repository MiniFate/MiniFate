## Introduction

### Roleplaying with {GameName}

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs.
They could tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization.
Or it could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into deep space in search of a new home.
It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs build influence through secrets and scandals.

Stories play out scene-by-scene.
The GM generally opens each scene with a quick description.
Play proceeds conversationally from there as the players and GM improvise back and forth.
Players speak as their PCs and describe their actions while the GM illustrates how the world responds.
Players may also ask the GM for further details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

Play is punctuated by die rolls, which mediate the divide between player and PC.
PC choices are made by the players, while the success of PC actions is judged by dice.
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with.
The dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true.
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs however they like.
