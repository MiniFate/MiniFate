## World Building

### Setting

For example, these aspects could set the stage for a sweeping fantasy epic:

{:.key-def}
|    Genre: | ~~Magic Fades at the Dawn of the Age of Men~~ |
| Conflict: | ~~Ancient Evil Returns After Millennia~~      |

...or a hyper-violent technological thriller:

{:.key-def}
|    Genre: | ~~Hacking, Guns, and Mirror Shades~~               |
| Conflict: | ~~Machines Enslaved Humanity After the First War~~ |

...or even a space opera with cowboys and sword fights:

{:.key-def}
|    Genre: | ~~Outlaws and Prophecies on the Outer Planets~~ |
| Conflict: | ~~Galaxy-Spanning Empire Tightens its Grip~~    |

You can come back and change them during character creation, or even after the story is underway!

Here are the aspects we decided on for our world:

> We want to play sky pirates in a steampunk fantasy world. We want magic,
> sword fights, and swashbuckling adventures in a world of intrigue where we
> can never be sure if we're the conman or the mark. We write down the
> following two Aspects:
> 
> {:.key-def}
> |    Genre: | ~~Steam-Powered Swashbuckling on the Seven Seas~~ |
> | Conflict: | ~~A Puppet-Master is Pulling All the Strings~~    |
 
In the next chapter we'll build our characters; from then on we'll use our
setting for examples.

### Scenes

Your game will take place across a number of scenes that exist within the
larger setting. Just as with your overall setting, each scene will have one or
more aspects that describes it.

The GM will often create these aspects as they describe the scene to the
players. Some examples:

- ~~An Army of Orcs Arrives at the Wall~~
- ~~Rust-Bucket Hovercraft in the Real World~~
- ~~Alien Bar Where The Authorities Dare Not Tread~~

Just as with setting aspects, don't be shy about updating scene aspects if the
story calls for it. Remember: aspects are always true! {% comment %} TODO: I don't
