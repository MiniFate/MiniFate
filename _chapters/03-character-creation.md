### Concept

### Trouble

### Skills

Skills give PCs mechanical weight and allow them to interact with the game
world. PCs begin with one skill at rank +2, and two skills at rank +1.

| Skill         | Used For                                                            |

| `Fight`       | Engaging in armed and unarmed melee combat                          |
| `Insight`     | Searching, tracking, finding, noticing, knowing                     |
| `Network`     | Knowing people, having access to things, having items on you        |
| `Performance` | Lying, singing, dancing, disguising                                 |
| `Persuasion`  | Negotiating, bargaining, flattering, empathizing                    |

| `Stealth`     | Hiding, moving silently, concealing objects on your person          |
| `Tinker`      | Picking locks, disarming traps, hacking computers, repairing things |

A default list of skills is provided later, but generating a set of skills is
a key part of game creation as it helps to define what actions the PCs will
take in response to the story.

A PC's Refresh determines how many Fate Points they start each session with.
PCs begin with a refresh of 2. {% comment %} TODO: Does this change? {% endcomment %}

#### Stress and Consequences

{% comment %} TODO: #57 Update stress and consequences: https://github.com/MiniFate/MiniFate/issues/57 {% endcomment %}

{% comment %} TODO: Do these numbers change? {% endcomment %}
PCs begin with three stress boxes and three consequences. When a PC is harmed
from losing a Skills contest (covered in the Skills section) they check off
their Stress Boxes. If no Stress Boxes remain, they must instead write a new
aspect for their character in one of the consequences slots.

Each level of consequence is more impactful and lasts for longer. Here are the
guidelines:

{% comment %} TODO: Can we just number consequences? {% endcomment %}
{% comment %} TODO: Can we nail down how long they last? Have we defined "Session". {% endcomment %}

_Mild_: Recovers in a scene or two and does not impact the PCs function much.
Generally the PC will have to spend a small amount of attention to fix it.
Examples are: `Covered in Alien Slime` or `Dropped My Gun`.

_Moderate_: Recovers after many scenes, and impacts the PCs ability to use
some skills as effectively as before. Examples are: `They Stole My
Father's Sword` or `Out Of Ammo`.

_Severe_: Recovery will involve actively working to fix it over several game
sessions and the effects may linger for a long time. In the moment the PC is
severely limited by it. This consequence is likely the most pressing thing for
the PC to deal with while it exists. Examples include: `They Sundered
My Family's Magic Shield` or `My Personality Split In Two`.
