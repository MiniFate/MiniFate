Dice rolls in MiniFate should be used sparingly. They add an element of
tension and unpredictability that keeps your story exciting; without them you
might as well just write a novel! But PCs are competent heroes especially in
the things their aspects imply they should be good at! If their is no
interesting result of failing a roll, assume the action happens and move on
with the story.

Fate Points are a currency the players and GM use to buy control of the
narrative. Players earn fate points by giving up control of their PC to the GM
temporarily and they can spend them to improve their rolls or declare
something about the world.

## Skill Rolls

From time to time, players will encounter situations where both success and failure are interesting.

A **Fearsome Captain** doesn't need to roll to defend himself from a **Nameless Deck-Hand**. There's no contest. But:

- Does he subdue the attacker before the others escape, burning the only bridge behind them?
- Maybe he recognizes the attacker?
- Maybe the attacker is scared, and can be calmed down with kind words?

Players can roll to:

- Inflict stress on another character (typically an NPC)
- Create a scene aspect with a free invocation
- Destroy a scene aspect

Roll outcomes:

- Fail
- Succeed at a Cost
- Succeed
- Succeed with Style

## Stress and Consequences

When a PC fails to defend themselves against an attack, they have three options:

- Mark a stress box of value N or greater, where N is the margin of the roll. Each PC has three stress boxes, valued 1, 2, and 3.
- Add a consequence of valued N or greater, where N is the value of the roll. Each PC has three consequence slots, valued 2, 4, and 6.
- Be out of the fight.

"Out of the fight" doesn't typically mean "dead." But it does mean the PC takes no more actions for the rest of the scene.

## Invoking Aspects

Spend a fate point to:

- Re-roll
- Add a +2 bonus to your roll

<!--- TODO: is two options dumb? -->

## Compels

Sometimes the GM will come up with a fun twist that makes a PC's life difficult.

Players can also compel the GM! Anyone can pay a fate point to add an aspect to the scene. The GM is allowed to refuse.

The fate point economy is a closed loop. When a player spends a fate point or compels the GM, that point goes to the GM. Same thing the other way. One exception: the GM can compel players even if they're out of fate points? In that case they just grab an extra fate point


## Examples

<!-- TODO: Where does this go? -->

> The _Angry Pig_ is slowly navigating an aether storm when Tor Byron hears
> the sound of grappling hooks biting into soft wood. "Goblin raiders! They
> must have be stalking us through the storm!" he calls out.
>
> Too late to talk it out, Tor Byron's player declares that his PC hefts his
> magic axe and charges the goblins, aiming to drive them off his boat. The
> Goblins have the aspect **Cowerdly Except in Large Numbers**.
>
> The GM asks Tor Byron to roll

Tor Byorn doesn't roll to see if he can steer a boat straight, we know he is a
former captain, of course he can! Likewise when the _Angry Pig_ is boarded by
aether Goblins Tor Byorn will roll `Fight` to drive them away, but his
eventual success is not really in doubt, instead he rolls to see if he can
defeat them before they make off with his treasure.
