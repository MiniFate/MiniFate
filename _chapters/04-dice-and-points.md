## Dice and Fate Points

<!--- TODO: better name -->

You don't need to roll that often, but you do want to roll *sometimes*.
It adds an element of tension and unpredictability to your story.

Fate points are a currency of narrative control. You can spend a fate point for a bonus on a roll, to modify a scene, or X

### Skill Rolls

From time to time, players will encounter situations where both success and failure are interesting.

A \aspect{Fearsome Captain} doesn't need to roll to defend himself from a \aspect{Nameless Deck-Hand}. There's no contest. But:

- Does he subdue the attacker before the others escape, burning the only bridge behind them?
- Maybe he recognizes the attacker?
- Maybe the attacker is scared, and can be calmed down with kind words?

Players can roll to:

- Inflict stress on another character (typically an NPC)
- Create a scene aspect with a free invocation
- Destroy a scene aspect

Roll outcomes:

- Fail
- Succeed at a Cost
- Succeed
- Succeed with Style

### Stress and Consequences

When a PC fails to defend themselves against an attack, they have three options:

- Mark a stress box of value N or greater, where N is the margin of the roll. Each PC has three stress boxes, valued 1, 2, and 3.
- Add a consequence of valued N or greater, where N is the value of the roll. Each PC has three consequence slots, valued 2, 4, and 6.
- Be out of the fight.

"Out of the fight" doesn't typically mean "dead." But it does mean the PC takes no more actions for the rest of the scene.

### Invoking Aspects

Spend a fate point to:

- Re-roll
- Add a +2 bonus to your roll

### Compels

Sometimes the GM will come up with a fun twist that makes a PC's life difficult.

Players can also compel the GM! Anyone can pay a fate point to add an aspect to the scene. The GM is allowed to refuse.

The fate point economy is a closed loop. When a player spends a fate point or compels the GM, that point goes to the GM. Same thing the other way. One exception: the GM can compel players even if they're out of fate points? In that case they just grab an extra fate point
