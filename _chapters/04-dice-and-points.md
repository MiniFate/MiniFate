MiniFate uses dice to add an element of unpredictability to the story. Without
them, you might as well be writing a novel! That said, it's not all up to
chance. Players can spend fate points to re-roll the dice at dramatically
appropriate moments, or even invent new aspects about the world. But watch
out---the GM has fate points as well, which they can use to complicate the
PCs' lives at just the wrong moment.

## Skill Rolls

Dice are an important part of MiniFate, but that doesn't mean you need to roll
for every little thing. As a general rule, the GM should prompt players for a
roll in situations where a competent hero might reasonably fail _and_ failure
adds an interesting twist to the story. For example, a ~~Swashbuckling
Genius~~ probably doesn't need to roll to fend off an attack by a ~~Nameless
Deck-Hand~~... but she might roll `Fight` to subdue him before his friends
escape, or `Network` to recognize him as a ~~Student of the Blade Dancers~~.

<!-- TODO: turn to prose -->

Players can roll to:

- Inflict stress on another character (typically an NPC)
- Create a scene aspect with a free invocation
- Destroy a scene aspect

Roll outcomes:

- Fail
- Succeed at a Cost
- Succeed
- Succeed with Style

## Stress and Consequences

When a PC fails to defend themselves against an attack, they have three options:

- Mark a stress box of value N or greater, where N is the margin of the roll. Each PC has three stress boxes, valued 1, 2, and 3.
- Add a consequence of valued N or greater, where N is the value of the roll. Each PC has three consequence slots, valued 2, 4, and 6.
- Be out of the fight.

"Out of the fight" doesn't typically mean "dead." But it does mean the PC takes no more actions for the rest of the scene.

## Invoking Aspects

Spend a fate point to:

- Re-roll
- Add a +2 bonus to your roll

## Compels

Sometimes the GM will come up with a fun twist that makes a PC's life difficult.

Players can also compel the GM! Anyone can pay a fate point to add an aspect to the scene. The GM is allowed to refuse.

The fate point economy is a closed loop. When a player spends a fate point or compels the GM, that point goes to the GM. Same thing the other way. One exception: the GM can compel players even if they're out of fate points? In that case they just grab an extra fate point


## Examples

<!-- TODO: Where does this go? -->

> Too late to talk it out, Tor Byron's player declares that his PC hefts his

> The GM asks Tor Byron to roll

Tor Byorn doesn't roll to see if he can steer a boat straight, we know he is a
former captain, of course he can! Likewise when the _Angry Pig_ is boarded by
aether Goblins Tor Byorn will roll `Fight` to drive them away, but his
eventual success is not really in doubt, instead he rolls to see if he can
defeat them before they make off with his treasure.
