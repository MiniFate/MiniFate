## Aspects and Fate Points

### Aspects

#### Story Aspects

Any Aspect not attached to a character is a story Aspect. Like character
Aspects, story Aspects are always true; unlike those Aspects, story Aspects
are dynamic. Creating an effect in the fiction is synonymous with creating a
story Aspect. Reversing that effect destroys the Aspect.

Story Aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene. For example,
maybe ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~.
They can also be created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching
a campfire can create ~~Pitch Blackness~~; wrestling someone to the ground
creates ~~Grappled~~.

The destruction of Aspects is similar. They can be destroyed manually by
rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~ Aspect is
destroyed. Story Aspects also are destroyed when they are no longer relevant,
or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is destroyed.
