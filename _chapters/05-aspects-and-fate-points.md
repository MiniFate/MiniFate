## Aspects and Fate Points

### Aspects

#### Story Aspects

Any aspect not attached to a character is a story aspect. Like character
aspects, story aspects are always true; unlike those aspects, story aspects
are dynamic. Creating an effect in the fiction is synonymous with creating a
story aspect. Reversing that effect destroys the aspect.

Story aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene. For example,
maybe ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~. They can also be
created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching a campfire can
create ~~Pitch Blackness~~; wrestling someone to the ground creates
~~Grappled~~.

The destruction of aspects is similar. They can be destroyed manually by
rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~ aspect is
destroyed. Story aspects also are destroyed when they are no longer relevant,
or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is destroyed.
