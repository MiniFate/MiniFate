## Aspects and Fate Points

{% include macros.html %}

### Aspects

An Aspect is a short phrase written about the in-game world by a player or the
GM. They are how the narrative interacts with the mechanics of the game,
allowing what makes a good story to drive what happens when the dice are
rolled. Aspects are how the players and the GM come to an agreed upon
understanding of the characters, the setting, and the current scene.

Some Aspects are attached to characters, allowing the player or GM to
express in their own words what makes the character unique and interesting.
Other Aspects refer to the world around the characters, or the story taking
place in it; an Aspect can be a detail within the current scene, a summary of
the overarching plot arc, or literally any other phrase that the players or GM
find pertinent.

Aspects have three roles, each of which is crucial to the game:

- **Aspects are always true**: They dictate what sort of play makes sense and
  what form a skill takes. If a character is ~~Grappled~~, it would not make
  sense for them to run away, swing a weapon, or do anything that requires
  free movement. If a character is a ~~Pyromancer of the Dancing Flame~~ then
  their `Shoot` attack will probably take the form of a conjured fireball; and
  they would be absolutely helpless if asked to pick up a crossbow.
- **Aspects can be invoked for a bonus on a roll**: If the dice say that
  ~~Sherwood Forest's Greatest Archer~~ is about to miss a tough shot, the
  player can spend a fate point to get a bonus on the roll.
- **Aspects can be compelled to create engaging plot twists**: Twists and
  turns make an engaging story; MiniFate encourages plot twists be
  compensating players when the narrative turns against them.

#### Story Aspects

Any Aspect not attached to a character is a story Aspect. Like character
Aspects, story Aspects are always true; unlike those Aspects, story Aspects
are dynamic. Creating an effect in the fiction is synonymous with creating a
story Aspect. Reversing that effect destroys the Aspect.

Story Aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene; for example, it
may bear noting that ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or that ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~.
They can also be created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching
a campfire can create ~~Pitch Blackness~~; wrestling someone to the ground
creates ~~Grappled~~.

The destruction of Aspects is similar. They can be destroyed manually by
rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~ Aspect is
destroyed. Story Aspects also are destroyed when they are no longer relevant,
or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is destroyed.

#### Hidden Aspects

Most character and story Aspects are visible to everyone at the table, but not
all of them. The GM may choose to keep some Aspects hidden.  Obvious examples
include monster weaknesses (~~Missing Scale Over His Heart~~), imminent
ambushes (~~Those Bushes Look Suspiciously Like Orcs~~), and the schemes and
motivations of NPCs (~~Lord Grofhurst Is My Unknowing Puppet~~). Hidden
Aspects serve more or less as the GM's notes; if invoked or compelled, they
must be revealed to everyone.

Sometimes the story revolves around an NPC with a secret or a hidden
motivation that should be revealed slowly. In this case, it is often best to
start with slightly suspicious public Aspects and then change them as the
players catch on.

> superhuman feats, his Aspect changes to ~~No Man Could Be As Strong~~, still
> indicating his strength, but hinting more directly at its hidden origins.
> Finally, when the players discover his true nature, his aspect is replaced
> with ~~Strength of a Dragon~~.

### Fate Points

Fate Points are a currency that can be spent to assert narrative control over
the game. Both the players and the GM have pools of Fate Points available to
spend. Players start each session with a number of Fate Points equal to their
PC's Refresh; additional Fate Points are earned by accepting compels during
the session.

The GM start each scene with as many Fate Points as there are PCs active in
the scene. Additionally, there is an unlimited pool of Fate Points that the
players and GM return their Fate Points to when they spend them, and from
which the GM pays players Fate Points for compels.

#### Declaring Aspects

Declaring an Aspects gives the players a chance to narrate a story detail.
The player propose a new aspect and, if the GM accepts it, they pay a Fate
point to bring the Aspect into being. Declaring an Aspect does not grant any
free invocations.

Declaring an aspect can be used to establish a connection with an new NPC
(~~The Barkeep Is From My Hometown~~) or dictate their motives (~~Traitorous
Minon~~), give a PC an item they need but might not have on them (~~Put My
Hair up with Lock Picks this Morning~~), impose unfortunate circumstances on
an enemy (~~Knock-off AK-47s Jam a Lot!~~), or even change the weather or
scenery (~~Sudden Snowstorm~~).  The power of declaring an aspect comes from
the fact that Aspects are true and so making the Aspect is just revealing a
previously unknown piece of the story.

The GM may declare aspects without paying a Fate point; narrating the in-game
world and deciding the actions of all the NPCs is specifically the purview of
the GM, it is only players that need to pay for the privilege.

#### Invoking Aspects

Fate Points can be spent to invoke Aspects for bonuses to rolls. To do so, the
player or GM spends a Fate Point, explains how one of the Aspects in play
would help the character making the roll or hinder their opponents, and then
either adds +2 to the result of the roll or re-throw all four of their dice.
Invoking an Aspect must make sense; the group should agree that the Aspect is
applicable with the GM being the final arbiter.

Players may spend Fate points to invoke Aspects for their own rolls and the GM
may spend Fate Points to invoke Aspects on rolls he makes for his NPCs.
Multiple aspects can be invoked on the same roll, but the same aspect cannot
be invoked more than once on the same roll (even if a fate point is used to
throw the dice again).Â 

Aspects need not be invoked all at once; a player may see whether they would
succeed with a roll before deciding whether to invoke any aspects. After
invoking an aspect, they may again see what the result would be before
deciding to let it stand, or invoking other aspects to gain a further bonus.

If two players are invoking aspects on a roll (for example, if a player's PC
is attack one of the GM's NPCs), then the roll is resolved only after both
players agree that they are finished. Again, each specific aspect may only be
invoked once per roll, so if both players want to invoke the same aspect the
group should decide for which character it would be more beneficial. If no
agreement can be reached, neither player may invoke it.

> The _Angry Pig_ has been impounded for failure to pay import taxes and Tor
> Byorn is trying to convince the officials to let it go in exchange for a
> future payment. After rolling his `Persuasion` against their `Insight`,
> the margin is -1, failure.
>
> Tor Byorn's player holds up one of the poker chips the group uses for fate
> points and says "As you know, I have ~~Lost My Boat in a Game of Cards~~
> before, and I'm not keen to lose another one." The GM takes the fate point
> and Tor Byorn adds +2 to his roll, converting it into a success. The _Angry
> Pig_ is released, for now.

### Compels <!-- TODO #59 Write compels: https://github.com/MiniFate/MiniFate/issues/59 -->

Sometimes the GM will come up with a fun twist that makes a PC's life
difficult. In this case they may compel a PC: the GM explain how a certain
aspect would lead to the story unfolding in a manner unfavorable to the PC and
the player may decide to accept the narration in exchange for a fate point.

The exact way in which things go wrong can be negotiated. If the player
accepts the compel, they receive a Fate Point and the GM narrates the results;
there are no rolls made and no skills are used, the story simply unfolds as
the GM dictates.

The GM can compel a character Aspects:

<!-- FIXME: This isn't great... But at least it's a start. It probably needs
an complete rewrite. -->

> Tor Byorn's group has snuck into Lord Kellett's chambers looking for a
> missing artifact and have stopped to discus what to do with the large safe
> they found.  While they talk, GM turns to Tor Byorn's player, holds up a
> Fate Point, and says, "Tor Byorn, ~~Why Are We Still Talking?~~ Just break
> the safe open with your hammer! Of course, it'll alert every guard in the
> building to your whereabouts but you can handle them." Tor Byron's player
> smiles and accepts the Fate point, so the GM narrates the result: "Tor Byorn
> walks over and slams his hammer into the safe's door, which makes a loud,
> booming sound that shakes the whole room..."

The GM can also compel story aspects:

> A goblin barge got the drop on the _Angry Pig_ by sailing too close to an
> aether storm. Although the barge is roughed up from the storm, its cannons
> have lined up a perfect shot on the _Pig's_ unarmored stern. Naka orders the
> crew to prepare to fight as she tosses a desperate fireball at the barge.
> She rolls `Shoot` against the Goblins' `Agility` as they try to steer around
> the fireball. Naka rolls extremely well while the GM rolls poorly for the
> Goblins.
>
> The GM turns to Naka: "A one in a million shot! Your fireball takes out all
> the rigging, the wheel, and even starts a major fire." The GM writes down
> the aspect ~~Out of control Inferno~~. "The barge should sink right through
> the clouds without causing you any more trouble... Or" he holds up a fate
> point, "Is the flaming wreck now on a collision course, sure to tangle with
> your rigging, and allowing dozens of goblins to spill out onto the _Angery
> Pig's_ deck as you fight the flames?"
>
> Naka's player thinks for a moment, takes the fate point, and calls out to
> the other players "Tor Byorn, I took out their steering! But it looks like
> they're heading right for us! Brace for impact!"

## Examples

<!-- TODO: Where does this go? -->

> The _Angry Pig_ is slowly navigating an aether storm when Tor Byron hears
> the sound of grappling hooks biting into soft wood. "Goblin raiders! They
> must have be stalking us through the storm!" he calls out.
>
> Too late to talk it out, Tor Byron's player declares that his PC hefts his
> magic axe and charges the goblins, aiming to drive them off his boat. The
> Goblins have the aspect ~~Cowardly Except in Large Numbers~~.
>
> The GM asks Tor Byron to roll

Tor Byorn doesn't roll to see if he can steer a boat straight, we know he is a
former captain, of course he can! Likewise when the _Angry Pig_ is boarded by
aether Goblins Tor Byorn will roll `Fight` to drive them away, but his
eventual success is not really in doubt, instead he rolls to see if he can
defeat them before they make off with his treasure.
