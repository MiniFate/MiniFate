## Aspects and Fate Points

{% include macros.html %}

An Aspect is a short, improvised phrase written about the in-game world by a
player or the GM. They are how the narrative interacts with the mechanics of
the game, allowing what makes a good story to drive what happens when the dice
are rolled. Aspects are how the players and the GM come to an agreed upon
understanding of the characters, the setting, and the current scene.

Some Aspects are attached to characters, allowing the player or GM to
express in their own words what makes the character unique and interesting.
Other Aspects refer to the world around the characters, or the story taking
place in it. An Aspect can be a detail within the current scene, a summary of
the overarching plot arc, or literally any other phrase that the players or GM
find pertinent.

Aspects have three roles, each of which is crucial to the game:

- **Aspects are always true**: They are how the table judges what play makes
  sense based on the story. If a character is ~~Grappled~~, they obviously
  cannot run away, swing a weapon, or do anything that requires free movement.
  Similarly, if a character is a ~~Pyromancer of the Dancing Flame~~ then
  their `Shoot` attack will probably take the form of a conjured fireball and
  they would be absolutely helpless if asked to pick up a crossbow.
- **Aspects can be invoked for a bonus on a roll**: If the dice say that
  ~~Sherwood's Greatest Archer~~ is about to miss a tough shot, the
  player can spend a fate point to get a bonus on the roll.
- **Aspects can be compelled to create engaging plot twists**: Twists and
  turns make an engaging story; MiniFate encourages plot twists by
  compensating players when the narrative turns against them. This helps to
  ensure that the players have fun even when their characters aren't.

### Aspects

#### Story Aspects

Any aspect not attached to a character is a story aspect. Like character
aspects, story aspects are always true. Unlike those aspects, story aspects
can change from moment to moment: creating an effect in the fiction is
represented by creating a story aspect and reversing that effect removes the
aspect.

Story aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene. For example,
maybe ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~. They can also be
created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching a campfire can
create ~~Pitch Blackness~~ while wrestling someone to the ground creates
~~Grappled~~.

The changing or removing an aspect is similar. A character can modify an
aspect by rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~
aspect is destroyed. Story aspects also are removed when they are no longer
relevant, or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is
destroyed.

#### Hidden Aspects

### Fate Points

Fate Points are a currency that can be spent to assert narrative control over
the game. Both the players and the GM have pools of Fate Points available to
spend. Players start each session with a number of Fate Points equal to their
PC's Refresh; additional Fate Points are earned by accepting compels during
the session.

The GM start each scene with as many Fate Points as there are PCs active in
the scene. Additionally, there is an unlimited pool of Fate Points that the
players and GM return their Fate Points to when they spend them, and from
which the GM pays players Fate Points for compels.

#### Declaring Aspects

#### Invoking Aspects

Fate Points can be spent to invoke aspects for bonuses to rolls. To do so, the
player spends a Fate Point, explains how one of the aspects in play would help
the character making the roll or hinder their opponents, and then either adds
+2 to the result of the roll or re-throw all four of their dice. Invoking an
aspect must make sense. The group should agree that the aspect is applicable
with the GM being the final arbiter.

Players may spend Fate points to invoke aspects for their own rolls and the GM
may spend Fate Points to invoke aspects on rolls he makes for his NPCs.
Multiple aspects can be invoked on the same roll, but the same aspect cannot
be invoked more than once on the same roll (even if a fate point is used to
throw the dice again).Â 

Aspects need not be invoked all at once. A player may see whether they would
succeed with a roll before deciding whether to invoke any aspects. After
invoking an aspect, they may again see what the result would be before
deciding to let it stand or invoking other aspects to gain a further bonus.

If two players are invoking aspects on a roll (for example, if a player's PC
is attack one of the GM's NPCs), then the roll is resolved only after both
players agree that they are finished. Again, each specific aspect may only be
invoked once per roll, so if both players want to invoke the same aspect the
group should decide for which character it would be more beneficial. If no
agreement can be reached, neither player may invoke it.

> Tor Byorn's player holds up one of the poker chips the group uses for fate
> points and says "As you know, I have ~~Lost My Boat in a Game of Cards~~
> before, and I'm not keen to lose another one." The GM takes the fate point
> and Tor Byorn adds +2 to his roll, converting it into a success. The _Angry
> Pig_ is released, for now, and the GM makes a note to come back to Tor
> Byorn's promise later.

fun with compels. If they aren't, then it's wrong.{% endcomment %}
