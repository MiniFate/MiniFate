## Aspects and Fate Points

{% include macros.html %}

An aspect is a short, improvised phrase written about the in-game world by a
player or the GM. They are how the narrative interacts with the mechanics of
the game, allowing what makes a good story to drive what happens when the dice
are rolled. Aspects are how the players and the GM come to an agreed upon
understanding of the characters, the setting, and the current scene.

Some aspects are attached to characters, allowing the player or GM to
express in their own words what makes the character unique and interesting.
Other aspects refer to the world around the characters, or the story taking
place in it. An aspect can be a detail within the current scene, a summary of
the overarching plot arc, or literally any other phrase that the players or GM
find pertinent.

Aspects have three roles, each of which is crucial to the game:

- **Aspects are always true**: They are how the table judges what play makes
  sense based on the story. If a character is ~~Grappled~~, they obviously
  cannot run away, swing a weapon, or do anything that requires free movement.
  Similarly, if a character is a ~~Pyromancer of the Dancing Flame~~ then
  their `Shoot` attack will probably take the form of a conjured fireball and
  they would be absolutely helpless if asked to pick up a crossbow.
- **Aspects can be invoked for a bonus on a roll**: If the dice say that
  ~~Sherwood's Greatest Archer~~ is about to miss a tough shot, the
  player can spend a fate point to get a bonus on the roll.
- **Aspects can be compelled to create engaging plot twists**: Twists and
  turns make an engaging story; MiniFate encourages plot twists by
  compensating players when the narrative turns against them. This helps to
  ensure that the players have fun even when their characters aren't.

### Aspects

#### Story Aspects

Any aspect not attached to a character is a story aspect. Like character
aspects, story aspects are always true. Unlike those aspects, story aspects
can change from moment to moment: creating an effect in the fiction is
represented by creating a story aspect and reversing that effect removes the
aspect.

Story aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene. For example,
maybe ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~. They can also be
created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching a campfire can
create ~~Pitch Blackness~~ while wrestling someone to the ground creates
~~Grappled~~.

The changing or removing an aspect is similar. A character can modify an
aspect by rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~
aspect is destroyed. Story aspects also are removed when they are no longer
relevant, or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is
destroyed.

> Undiscouraged, the Dwarf starts looking for a way to brighten up the night,
> perhaps with some fire...

#### Hidden Aspects

Most character and story aspects are visible to everyone at the table, but not
all of them. The GM may choose to keep some aspects hidden.  Obvious examples
include monster weaknesses (**Missing Scale Over His Heart**), imminent
ambushes (**Those Bushes Look Suspiciously Like Orcs**), and the schemes and
motivations of NPCs (**Lord Grofhurst Is My Unknowing Puppet**). Hidden
aspects serve more or less as the GM's notes; if invoked or compelled, they
must be revealed to everyone.

Sometimes the story revolves around an NPC with a secret or a hidden
motivation that should be revealed slowly. In this case, it is often best to
start with slightly suspicious public aspects and then change them as the
players catch on.

> Lord Kellett is secretly a Dragon in human form. He starts with the aspect
> **Strong as Ten Men** which indicates his incredible strength, but is poetic
> enough to be overlooked.  Later, as the PCs observe him performing more and
> more superhuman feats, his aspect changes to **No Man Could Be As Strong**,
> still indicating his strength, but hinting more directly at its hidden
> origins. Finally, when the players discover his true nature, his aspect is
> replaced with **Strength of a Dragon**.

### Fate Points

#### Declaring Aspects

#### Invoking Aspects

Fate Points can be spent to invoke aspects for bonuses to rolls. To do so, the
player spends a Fate Point, explains how one of the aspects in play would help
the character making the roll or hinder their opponents, and then either adds
+2 to the result of the roll or re-throw all four of their dice. Invoking an
aspect must make sense. The group should agree that the aspect is applicable
with the GM being the final arbiter.

Players may spend Fate points to invoke aspects for their own rolls and the GM
may spend Fate Points to invoke aspects on rolls he makes for his NPCs.
Multiple aspects can be invoked on the same roll, but the same aspect cannot
be invoked more than once on the same roll (even if a fate point is used to
throw the dice again). 

Aspects need not be invoked all at once. A player may see whether they would
succeed with a roll before deciding whether to invoke any aspects. After
invoking an aspect, they may again see what the result would be before
deciding to let it stand or invoking other aspects to gain a further bonus.

If two players are invoking aspects on a roll (for example, if a player's PC
is attack one of the GM's NPCs), then the roll is resolved only after both
players agree that they are finished. Again, each specific aspect may only be
invoked once per roll, so if both players want to invoke the same aspect the
group should decide for which character it would be more beneficial. If no
agreement can be reached, neither player may invoke it.

> and Tor Byorn adds +2 to his roll, converting it into a success. The _Angry
> Pig_ is released, for now, and the GM makes a note to come back to Tor
> Byorn's promise later.
