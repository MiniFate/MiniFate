## Aspects and Fate Points

{% include macros.html %}

An Aspect is a short, improvised phrase written about the in-game world by a
player or the GM. They are how the narrative interacts with the mechanics of
the game, allowing what makes a good story to drive what happens when the dice
are rolled. Aspects are how the players and the GM come to an agreed upon
understanding of the characters, the setting, and the current scene.

Some Aspects are attached to characters, allowing the player or GM to
express in their own words what makes the character unique and interesting.
Other Aspects refer to the world around the characters, or the story taking
place in it. An Aspect can be a detail within the current scene, a summary of
the overarching plot arc, or literally any other phrase that the players or GM
find pertinent.

Aspects have three roles, each of which is crucial to the game:

- **Aspects are always true**: They dictate what sort of play makes sense and
  what form a skill takes. If a character is ~~Grappled~~, it would not make
  sense for them to run away, swing a weapon, or do anything that requires
  free movement. If a character is a ~~Pyromancer of the Dancing Flame~~ then
  their `Shoot` attack will probably take the form of a conjured fireball; and
  they would be absolutely helpless if asked to pick up a crossbow.
- **Aspects can be invoked for a bonus on a roll**: If the dice say that
  ~~Sherwood's Greatest Archer~~ is about to miss a tough shot, the
  player can spend a fate point to get a bonus on the roll.
- **Aspects can be compelled to create engaging plot twists**: Twists and
  turns make an engaging story; MiniFate encourages plot twists by
  compensating players when the narrative turns against them. This helps to
  ensure that the players have fun even when their characters aren't.
