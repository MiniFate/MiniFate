## Aspects and Fate Points

#### Invoking Aspects

Fate Points can be spent to invoke aspects for bonuses to rolls. To do so, the
player spends a Fate Point, explains how one of the aspects in play would help
the character making the roll or hinder their opponents, and then either adds
+2 to the result of the roll or re-throw all four of their dice. Invoking an
aspect must make sense. The group should agree that the aspect is applicable
with the GM being the final arbiter.

Players may spend Fate points to invoke aspects for their own rolls and the GM
may spend Fate Points to invoke aspects on rolls he makes for his NPCs.
Multiple aspects can be invoked on the same roll, but the same aspect cannot
be invoked more than once on the same roll (even if a fate point is used to
throw the dice again).Â 

Aspects need not be invoked all at once. A player may see whether they would
succeed with a roll before deciding whether to invoke any aspects. After
invoking an aspect, they may again see what the result would be before
deciding to let it stand or invoking other aspects to gain a further bonus.

If two players are invoking aspects on a roll (for example, if a player's PC
is attack one of the GM's NPCs), then the roll is resolved only after both
players agree that they are finished. Again, each specific aspect may only be
invoked once per roll, so if both players want to invoke the same aspect the
group should decide for which character it would be more beneficial. If no
agreement can be reached, neither player may invoke it.
