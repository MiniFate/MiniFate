## Aspects and Fate Points

### Aspects

#### Story Aspects

Any aspect not attached to a character is a story aspect. Like character
aspects, story aspects are always true. Unlike those aspects, story aspects
can change from moment to moment: creating an effect in the fiction is
represented by creating a story aspect and reversing that effect removes the
aspect.

Story aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene. For example,
maybe ~~It's Raining Hard~~ or ~~Everyone Seems On-Edge~~. They can also be
created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching a campfire can
create ~~Pitch Blackness~~ while wrestling someone to the ground creates
~~Grappled~~.

The changing or removing an aspect is similar. A character can modify an
aspect by rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the ~~Grappled~~
aspect is destroyed. Story aspects also are removed when they are no longer
relevant, or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, ~~Pitch Blackness~~ is
destroyed.
