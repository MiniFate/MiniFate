## Conflicts and Combat

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally roll a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But during particularly eventful scenes where the PCs
need to accomplish something complicated they will have to roll multiple
skills in close succession. That's when you turn to a **Challenge**.

During a challenge, the GM will set out a list of things that must be
accomplished to succeed.

Challenges let each member of the group use their particular skills to help
solve the problem. The GM will set out a list of tasks that must be
accomplished to succeed and a target difficulty. When making the list, the GM
should consider both what makes sense for the story and what will involve all
the players. The players then decide which of their characters will handle
each task, describe how they approach them, and roll their skills.

The GM then uses the success, failure, and consequences inflicted from each
task to determine the outcome of the challenge. Some tasks will likely fail,
but this doesn't mean the challenge failed. Instead use those failures to
flavor the outcome, adding interesting twists to the outcome.
