## Conflicts and Combat

<!-- TODO: I'd like to stick with the standard nomenclature (conflict,
challenge, contest) where it works, but I'd love to have *ONE WORD* that
describes it all... -->

{% include macros.html %}

Most of the gameplay in MiniFate is roleplaying with the occasional dice roll
to determine which path the story continues down. But sometimes the players
will want to do something that requires many skill checks within a short
amount of time, at which point they turn to _TODO_.

A _contest_ is for when the characters are trying to accomplish something that
requires multiple tasks to be accomplished at roughly the same time.

A _conflict_ is for when the characters are directly opposed by another group
and actively attempting to harm them.

A conflict could be fighting a group of henchmen or deciphering the cult's
demonic texts before the party is discovered. During a conflict play becomes
more structured, each character gets a turn, and they roll dice to determine
the outcome for almost all actions.

### Starting

#### Zones

During a conflict it is important to know exactly where each character is.
{GameName} uses zones for this. Zones are rough representation of the space
where the battle is taking place. If you are using a map, draw a few zones for
each area, otherwise you can just describe what and where the zones are. Two
to four zones is a good number for most conflicts; fewer zones makes the
conflict feel more narrative while adding zones makes it feel more tactical.

Characters in the same zone can interact with each other and any object in the
zone, but need permission from one of their aspects to interact with things
outside the zone. A character may freely move to an adjacent zone on their
turn in addition to their action.

Zone aspects may restrict free movement or visibility between zones; consider
what makes sense from a narrative perspective when deciding whether a
character can move or act over a zone boundary.

> The _Angry Pig_ is circling a mountain outpost exchanging canon fire after a
> failed attempt to bypass the Empire's northern boarder. There are three
> zones on the board: The _Angry Pig_, the sky, and the outpost. The sky has
> the aspect ~~A Very Long Way Down~~.

> Tor Byorn is stuck on the _Angry Pig_, unable to bring his axe to bear on
> the canons poking holes in his ship since the sky's aspect indicates that he
> can't cross the zone. Tor Byorn's player decides the Dwarf has had enough
> enough and roles `Agility` to create the aspect ~~Flying Leap~~ which gives
> him the ability to cross the intervening zones. If the Dwarf's rolls
> succeeds, his aspect will allow him to jump the gap between the ship and
> outpost, if he rolls poorly... Well, it is a very long way down.

seems cleaner. {% endcomment %}

#### Turn Order

Turn order is decided by the narrative. Look to the aspects on the scene and
use them to determine which group should have momentum going into the
encounter. That group decides which of their characters will act first.

When that character has acted, their player picks a character---on either side
of the conflict---to go next. Players continue picking characters until each
one has acted. The last player to go picks the character to go first in the
next round, which may include themselves.

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally role a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But sometimes the PCs need to accomplish something
big, which would require rolling multiple skills in close succession. That's
when you turn to a **Challenge**.

During a challenge, the GM will set out a list of things that must be
accomplished to succeed.
