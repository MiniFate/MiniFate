## Conflicts and Combat

<!-- TODO: I'd like to stick with the standard nomenclature (conflict,
challenge, contest) where it works, but I'd love to have *ONE WORD* that
describes it all... -->

{% include macros.html %}

### Starting

#### Zones

During a conflict it is important to know exactly where each character is.
{GameName} uses zones for this. Zones are rough representation of the space
where the battle is taking place. If you are using a map, draw a few zones for
each area, otherwise you can just describe what and where the zones are. Two
to four zones is a good number for most conflicts; fewer zones makes the
conflict feel more narrative while adding zones makes it feel more tactical.

Characters in the same zone can interact with each other and any object in the
zone, but need permission from one of their aspects to interact with things
outside the zone. A character may freely move to an adjacent zone on their
turn in addition to their action.

Zone aspects may restrict free movement or visibility between zones; consider
what makes sense from a narrative perspective when deciding whether a
character can move or act over a zone boundary.

> The {BoatName} is circling a mountain outpost exchanging canon fire after a
> failed attempt to bypass the Empire's northern boarder. There are three
> zones on the board: The {BoatName}, the sky, and the outpost. The sky has
> the aspect `A Very Long Way Down`.
>
> Tor Byorn is stuck on the {BoatName}, unable to bring his axe to bear on
> the canons poking holes in his ship since the sky's aspect indicates that he
> can't cross the zone. Tor Byorn's player decides the Dwarf has had enough
> enough and roles `Agility` to create the aspect `Flying Leap` which gives
> him the ability to cross the intervening zones. If the Dwarf's rolls
> succeeds, his aspect will allow him to jump the gap between the ship and
> outpost, if he rolls poorly... Well, it is a very long way down.

seems cleaner. {% endcomment %}

#### Turn Order

Turn order is decided by the narrative. Look to the aspects on the scene and
use them to determine which group should have momentum going into the
encounter. That group decides which of their characters will act first.

When that character has acted, their player picks a character---on either side
of the conflict---to go next. Players continue picking characters until each
one has acted. The last player to go picks the character to go first in the
next round, which may include themselves.

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally roll a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But during particularly eventful scenes where the PCs
need to accomplish something complicated they will have to roll multiple
skills in close succession. That's when you turn to a **Challenge**.

Challenges let each member of the group use their particular skills to help
solve the problem. The GM will set out a list of tasks that must be
accomplished to succeed and a target difficulty. When making the list, the GM
should consider both what makes sense for the story and what will involve all
the players. The players then decide which of their characters will handle
each task, describe how they approach them, and roll their skills.

The GM then uses the success, failure, and consequences inflicted from each
task to determine the outcome of the challenge. Some tasks will likely fail,
but this doesn't mean the challenge failed. Instead use those failures to
flavor the outcome, adding interesting twists to the outcome.

> A captured mage that Tor Byorn and Naka were transporting has escaped! On
> her way out she sabotaged the {BoatName}, injured multiple crew members,
> and accidentally left one of her books behind. Now the {BoatName} is losing
> altitude over the great desert while the escapee's trail grows colder by the
> moment.
>
> The GM sets up a challenge to see how the players proceed. He comes up with
> three tasks:
>
> - Decipher the convict's book (difficulty 4)
> - Avoid the mega cacti that are just now peaking out of the clouds
>   (difficulty 1)
> - Repair the gas exchanger to restore lift (difficulty 2)
>
> Tor Byorn's player thinks avoiding the obstacles is their top priority so he
> runs to the helm and grabs the wheel, shoving aside the current helmsman. He
> isn't the best at steering (+0 `Agility`) but the task isn't too difficult
> and he rolls well enough ({{dice-pzpp}}) that he succeeds.
>
> Naka rushes to the engine room to see what is wrong and discovers a big hole
> in the gas exchanger. They're going to hit the ground hard if it's not
> fixed. Naka tries to repair it (+0 `Tinker`) but comes up short
> ({{dice-nnzp}}). She throws her hands (and the wrench she had been
> attempting to use) in the air and storms back up to the main deck.
>
> Meanwhile Tor Byorn has been getting ready to "help" Naka decipher the book
> by gathering _every other written work on the boat_ into a big pile. He rolled
> `Network` (+1) to create the aspect `Big Pile of study material` with a
> free invocation for Naka.
> 
> The pyromancer frantically scans the pages, but books were never her best
> subject (+0 `Insight`). She rolls ({{dice-pzpz}}) which isn't enough, even
> with the +2 from Tor Byorn's aspect. She looks to the GM and says "I've
> `Never met a problem my magic couldn't ignite`. I might be a pyromaniac,
> but I'm also a trained mage. I have studied lots of arcane books before in
> the imperial college before they tossed me out." The player hands over a
> fate point and gets another +2, tying the difficulty.
>
> The GM surveys the results and thinks a moment before narrating the results:
>
> "Due to some skillful (or lucky) piloting you avoid the massive cacti as the
> ship careens down towards the desert floor. Unfortunately the damage is
> beyond repair in the time you have so the {BoatName} is going to have a
> hard landing. Naka spent the last few minutes trying to read the book and
> resisting the urge to set it on fire. Just before impact she looks up at Tor
> Byorn with a confused look and mutters "I can't read this... It's written in
> Draconic! Why does a mage know the language of dragons?" Tor Byorn has just
> an instant to look puzzled before both of your are thrown overboard as the
> ship hits the sand."
