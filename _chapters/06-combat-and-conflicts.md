## Conflicts and Combat

{% include macros.html %}

Most of the gameplay in MiniFate is roleplaying punctuated by the occasional
dice roll. But occasionally the players will want or need to do something that
requires many skill checks within a short amount of time whether that is
fighting a group of henchmen or deciphering the cult's demonic texts before
they are discovered.

### Starting

#### Turn Order

Turn order is decided by the narrative. Look to the aspects on the scene and
use them to determine which group should have momentum going into the
encounter. That group decides which of their characters will act first. When
that character has acted, their player picks a character---on either side of
the conflict---to go next. The last player to go during the turn picks the
character to go first in the next round, including themselves.

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally role a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But sometimes the PCs need to accomplish something
big, which would require rolling multiple skills in close succession. That's
when you turn to a **Challenge**.

During a challenge, the GM will set out a list of things that must be
accomplished to succeed.
