### Starting

#### Zones

#### Turn Order

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally role a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But sometimes the PCs need to accomplish something
big, which would require rolling multiple skills in close succession. That's
when you turn to a **Challenge**.

During a challenge, the GM will set out a list of things that must be
accomplished to succeed.
