## Conflicts and Combat

<!-- TODO: I'd like to stick with the standard nomenclature (conflict,
challenge, contest) where it works, but I'd love to have *ONE WORD* that
describes it all... -->

{% include macros.html %}

Most of the gameplay in MiniFate is roleplaying punctuated by the occasional
dice roll. But sometimes the players will want or need to do something that
requires many skill checks within a short amount of time, at which point they
turn to Conflicts.

A conflict could be fighting a group of henchmen or deciphering the cult's
demonic texts before the party is discovered. During a conflict play becomes
more structured, each character gets a turn, and they roll dice to determine
the outcome for almost all actions.

### Starting

#### Zones

#### Turn Order

Turn order is decided by the narrative. Look to the aspects on the scene and
use them to determine which group should have momentum going into the
encounter. That group decides which of their characters will act first.

When that character has acted, their player picks a character---on either side
of the conflict---to go next. Players continue picking characters until each
one has acted. Then the last player to go picks the character to go first in
the next round, which may include themselves.

### Challenges

In normal play, the characters will occasionally role a skill to determine the
direction of the story. But sometimes the PCs need to accomplish something
big, which would require rolling multiple skills in close succession. That's
when you turn to a **Challenge**.

During a challenge, the GM will set out a list of things that must be
accomplished to succeed.

### Contests

### Conflict

### Recovering
