# Introduction

Robin Hood is a beloved outlaw, skilled with both sword and bow.
He leads a band of Merry Men against the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.
And he's in love with Maid Marian.
With just those three sentences, we're ready for a story.
Everything else --- where he's from, what he carries, when the story is set --- can wait until it becomes important.

{gameName} is a role-playing game that takes that same theatricality to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details matter.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.




The core mechanic of {gameName} is Aspects: short improvised phrases about the in-game world.

### More About Aspects

Aspects are always true

Aspects don't need to tell you everything. They just need to keep everyone on the same page.

Pop culture references are fine! A zombie can be ~~Braaains~~

Not everyone can see every aspect! Or maybe, GM can keep their own notes hidden. Kellett as an example.




# Introduction

When you watch a movie or read a book, you don't worry about tracking fuel, rations, or ammunition.
That's not what the story is about.
Or, if it is, it'll be raised explicitly as a source of tension.
You focus on what's important and suspend disbelief for the bookkeeping.

{GameName} is a roleplaying game that takes that idea to heart.
Players get to decide what sort of story they're telling, and what details are important to it.
Everything else is allowed to slide.
The result is a punchy, quick-moving game with plenty of opportunities for memorable moments.

the sore mechanic is...
Under the hood, {GameName} runs on aspects and fate points. Same engine as Fate Core
If you're familiar with Fate Core, {GameName} may look familiar
{GameName} is a riff on Fate Core. We are long-time players




 and uses the same fundamental mechanics: skills and aspects. Skills
are numerical bonuses applied to dice rolls, ensuring the story is exciting
and unpredictable but not random. Aspects are short, improvised phrases to
keep the whole group on the page about what's important to the story and to
provide a framework for players to riff off each other in creative and
constructive ways.
