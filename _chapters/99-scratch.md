## More About Aspects

Aspects are always true

Aspects don't need to tell you everything. They just need to keep everyone on the same page.

Pop culture references are fine! A zombie can be **Braaains**

Not everyone can see every aspect! Or maybe, GM can keep their own notes hidden. Kellett as an example.
