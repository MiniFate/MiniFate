# Aspects and Fate Points

## Aspects

Each character is created with two Aspects (see the character creation rules
in chapter **X**). The player can use these Aspects to showcase whatever they
feel is important about their character, such as their job (**Deep-Woods
Lumberjack**), something important they carry (**Crown of a Deposed King**),
what motivates them (**Lord Kellett Will Pay for the Greywood Massacre**), the
sort of trouble they tend to get into (**Owes a Lot to the Wrong People**),
and so on. These Aspects serve to introduce the character to the rest of the
table. Characters gain more Aspects as time goes on, in order to illustrate
their growth and the new relationships they form (as discussed in the
character advancement rules in chapter **Y**).

<!--TODO: Can they really showcase whatever they want at creation if we have a
high concept and trouble aspect?-->

## Fate Points

Fate Points are a currency that can be spent to assert narrative control over
the game. Both the players and the GM have pools of Fate Points available to
spend. Players start each session with a number of Fate Points equal to their
character's Refresh; additional Fate Points are earned by accepting compels
during the session. The GM start each scene with as many Fate Points as there
are PCs active in the scene. Additionally, there is an unlimited pool of Fate
Points that the players and GM return their Fate Points to when they spend
them, and from which the GM pays players Fate Points for compels.

<!-- TODO: There must be a cleaner way to explain the "unlimited pool" or bank
of Fate points. Maybe start with that, and then explain how the players and GM
get to take points out of it? -->

Fate Points are spent to do one of two things:

1. Invoke an Aspect
2. Declaring an Aspect
