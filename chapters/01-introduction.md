# Introduction

*Introduction to Roleplaying*? *Introduction to MiniFate*?

Idea here would be to introduce the acronyms **GM**, **PC**, and **NPC**, and give a few sentences about how RPGs work. We have some pretty good existing content for this!

Probably also want to address game materials.

# Next...

Fate Core starts by going through the character sheet to introduce the ideas of aspects, skills, etc. For a short document, it's probably better to jump right in. Possible entry points:

- Character creation. Nest aspects and skills under.
- Aspects. They are always true! Short improvised statements.
- Skills. These are the numbers you use to roll dice.
