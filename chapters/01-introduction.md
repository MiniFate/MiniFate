# Introduction

**MiniFate** is a roleplaying game that allows the players to tell a
collaborative story. It has just enough rules to help the group decide what
happens while staying out of the way of the narrative.

Each player controls a player character (**PC**) in a shared world. The
gamemaster (**GM**) plays the rest of the world and the non-player characters
(**NPC**s). Together they tell the story of the characters until they come to
the point where there is a question as to how the story should proceed; that
is when they turn to the rules to help decide.

Fate Core starts by going through the character sheet to introduce the ideas of aspects, skills, etc. For a short document, it's probably better to jump right in. Possible entry points:

- Character creation. Nest aspects and skills under.
- Aspects. They are always true! Short improvised statements.
- Skills. These are the numbers you use to roll dice.
