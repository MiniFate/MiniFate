# Game Creation

Character creation and setting creation go hand-in-hand, because setting are
defined by their characters and characters by their setting. A \aspect{Pirate Captain
Who Hates Violence} in a world with \aspect{Magic Returning, Disrupting
Everything} is very different than one on the \aspect{Blood Drenched Sands of the
Caribbean}.

The game creation process should be collaborative, so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the setting and the PCs as a group.
It is good to start with a very broad definition of the setting and then build
PCs, using their creation to find out more details of the setting.

## Setting

The setting of the story could be as large or small as needed. To start,
decide what kind of setting you want the story to take place in. Then use
Aspects to make the setting concrete. These Aspects will help get the group
all on the same page. Good hooks for Setting Aspects and some examples are:

- _Major Conflicts_: \aspect{Plucky Rebels Defend Their Home From A
  Galaxy-spanning Empire} or \aspect{An Ancient Evil Once Again Threatens the
  Reamls of Men, Dwarves, and Elves} 
- _Major Technology/Magic_: \aspect{Highschool Where Everyone Has
  Superpowers} or \aspect{In the Near Future, Cybernetics Let Anyone Improve
  Themselves for A Price}
- _Major Themes_: \aspect{In the Darkness of the Far Future, Humanity Fights for
  Survival} or \aspect{The Mob Runs This Town}.
- _Major Groups_: \aspect{A Starship Crew Boldly Explores the Galaxy} or \aspect{A
  Shadowy Government Agency Hides Magic from Normal People}

Write as many or as few Aspects as you need to define your setting and so
everyone understands what does and does not belong in it. You can always
update these Aspects later, including once the game has started, as the
setting changes in response to changes in the narrative.

### Scenes

Your game will take place across a number of scenes that exist within the
larger Setting. Just as with your overall setting, each scene will have one or
more Aspects that describes it.

The GM will generally create these Aspects as they are describing the scene to
the players. Some examples: \aspect{An Alien Bar Where The Authorities Dare Not
Tread}, \aspect{The Mob's Docks At Midnight}, or \aspect{An Ancient Fortification
Surrounded by Orcs}.

Just as with Setting Aspects, Scene Aspects should be changed or updated as
play proceeds to reflect changes in the narrative.

## Characters

PCs in MiniFate are mechanically simple but narratively diverse. Starting PCs
have of two Aspects---their Concept and Trouble---and a set of skills. All PCs
have three Stress Boxes, three Consequences, and a Refresh of 2. Aspects and
Skills are covered in depth later.

### Concept

Creating a PC begins with coming up with their Concept. The Concept is an
Aspect that describes broadly who the PC is and why they are unique, exciting
people that we care about. Some example Concepts are: \aspect{Backwater Farm
Boy Looking to Join The Academy}, \aspect{Rightful King of Gondor}, or
\aspect{Master Swordsmen Looking to Avenge His Father}.

Your Concept is the thing you would tell someone first when they ask "Who are
you playing?". It helps to keep in mind what sort of story hooks would be
associated with it.

### Trouble

The PC's second Aspect is their Trouble; it describes the sort of things that
get in the PC's way and make their story interesting. The trouble Aspect
should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to cause the PC
trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in game.  Instead, a
PC's trouble Aspect is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of
problems they would find interesting to deal with.

A hardboiled detective might drink excessively, but \aspect{Can't Resist a
Drink} might not add much roleplaying potential, whereas \aspect{Softspot for
Losers Like Me} offers the GM and other players a lot of story hooks.

Some example Troubles are: \aspect{I Don't Know Which Side I'm On},
\aspect{Everyone I Get Close To Ends Up In Trouble}, or \aspect{My Past Is A
Dangerous Mystery; Even to Me}.

### Skills

Skills give PCs mechanical weight and allow them to interact with the game
world. PCs begin with one skill at rank +2, and two skills at rank +1.

A default list of skills is provided later, but generating a set of skills is
a key part of game creation as it helps to define what actions the PCs will
take in response to the story.

### Refresh

A PC's Refresh determines how many Fate Points they start each session with.
PCs begin with a refresh of 2.

### Stress and Consequences

Stress Boxes and Consequences represent how a PC is effected by various forms
of harm. PCs begin with three stress boxes and three consequences (labeled
Mild, Moderate, and Severe). When a PC is harmed from losing a Skills contest
(covered in the Skills section) they check off their Stress Boxes. If no
Stress Boxes remain, they must instead write a new Aspect for their character
in one of the consequences slots.

Each level of consequence is more impactful and lasts for longer. Here are the
guidelines:

- _Mild_: Recovers in a scene or two and does not impact the PCs function
  much. Generally the PC will have to spend a small amount of attention to fix
  it. Examples are: \aspect{Bloody Nose}, \aspect{Exhausted}, or
  \aspect{Dropped My Gun}.
- _Moderate_: Recovers after many scenes, and impacts the PCs ability to use
  some skills as effectively as before. Examples are: \aspect{They Stole My
  Father's Sword}, \aspect{Depressed}, \aspect{Out Of Ammo}.
- _Severe_: Recovery will involve actively working to fix it over several game
  sessions and the effects may linger for a long time. In the moment the PC is
  severely limited by it. This consequence is likely the most pressing thing
  for the PC to deal with while it exists. Examples include: \aspect{My Bloody
  Arm Is Off}, \aspect{They Sundered My Family's Magic Shield}, \aspect{My
  Personality Split In Two}.
