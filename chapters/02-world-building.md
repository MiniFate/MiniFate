# Game Creation

Character creation and setting creation go hand-in-hand, because setting are
defined by their characters and characters by their setting. A \aspect{Pirate Captain
Who Hates Violence} in a world with \aspect{Magic Returning, Disrupting
Everything} is very different than one on the \aspect{Blood Drenched Sands of the
Caribbean}.

The game creation process should be collaborative, so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the setting and the PCs as a group.
It is good to start with a very broad definition of the setting and then build
PCs, using their creation to find out more details of the setting.

## Setting

The setting of the story could be as large or small as needed. To start,
decide what kind of setting you want the story to take place in. Then use
Aspects to make the setting concrete. These Aspects will help get the group
all on the same page. Good hooks for Setting Aspects and some examples are:

- _Major Conflicts_: \aspect{Plucky Rebels Defend Their Home From A
  Galaxy-spanning Empire} or \aspect{An Ancient Evil Once Again Threatens the
  Realms of Men, Dwarves, and Elves} 
- _Major Technology/Magic_: \aspect{Highschool Where Everyone Has
  Superpowers} or \aspect{Cybernetics Let Anyone Improve
  Themselves for A Price}
- _Major Themes_: \aspect{Humanity Fights for
  Survival in the Far Future} or \aspect{The Mob Runs This Town}.
- _Major Groups_: \aspect{Starship Crew Boldly Explores the Galaxy} or \aspect{
  Shadowy Government Agency Hides Magic from Normal People}

Write as many or as few Aspects as you need to define your setting and so
everyone understands what does and does not belong in it. You can always
update these Aspects later, including once the game has started, as the
setting changes in response to changes in the narrative.

### Scenes

Your game will take place across a number of scenes that exist within the
larger Setting. Just as with your overall setting, each scene will have one or
more Aspects that describes it.

The GM will generally create these Aspects as they describe the scene to
the players. Some examples: \aspect{Alien Bar Where The Authorities Dare Not
Tread}, \aspect{Mob's Docks At Midnight}, or \aspect{Ancient Fortification
Surrounded by Orcs}.

Just as with Setting Aspects, Scene Aspects should be changed or updated as
play proceeds to reflect changes in the narrative.
