# World Building

In MiniFate, character creation and setting creation happen together. Players
and the GM may show up to the first session with rough ideas, but ultimately
settings are defined by their characters and vice versa. A \aspect{Pirate
Captain Who Hates Violence} in a world with \aspect{Magic is Suddenly Real} is
very different than one on the \aspect{Blood Drenched Sands of the Caribbean}.

The game creation process should be collaborative, so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the setting and the PCs as a group.
It is good to start with a very broad definition of the setting and then build
PCs, using their creation to find out more details of the setting.

## Setting

To start, decide what kind of setting you want for your story. Then work
together to write down the aspects. This way, you know everyone is on the
same page about important themes and conflicts.

Don't worry about getting the Aspects perfect because you will update these
Aspects later in response to changes in the narrative. As long as everyone has
a good sense of what belongs in the setting and what doesn't you're ready to
go.

Your setting will have two Aspects: the Genre and the Conflict.

### Genre

The Genre is the one sentence summary of your setting. It is big picture:
where, when, and what. For example: 

- \aspect{Mega Tokyo After The Bomb Dropped}
- \aspect{Mirror shades, trench coats, hacking, and lots of guns}.
- \aspect{High School Where Everyone Has Superpowers}

### Conflict

Your setting's Conflict focuses on the details: the who and the why. Its it
what drives your PCs to action. For example, 

- \aspect{Galaxy-spanning Empire Tightens Its Grip}
- \aspect{An Ancient Evil Once Again Threatens the Realms of Men, Dwarves, and
  Elves} 
- \aspect{Machines Enslaved Us After the First War}

## Scenes

Your game will take place across a number of scenes that exist within the
larger setting. Just as with your overall setting, each scene will have one or
more Aspects that describes it.

The GM will often create these Aspects as they describe the scene to the
players. Some examples: \aspect{Alien Bar Where The Authorities Dare Not
Tread}, \aspect{Mob's Docks At Midnight}, or \aspect{Ancient Fortification
Surrounded by Orcs}.

Just as with setting Aspects, don't be shy about updating Scene Aspects if the
story calls for it. Remember: aspects are always true! <!-- TODO: I don't
think we've ever said this before.-->
