# World Building

In MiniFate, character creation and setting creation happen together. Players
and the GM may show up to the first session with rough ideas, but ultimately
settings are defined by their characters and vice versa. A \aspect{Pirate
Captain Who Hates Violence} in a world with \aspect{Magic is Suddenly Real} is
very different than one on the \aspect{Blood Drenched Sands of the Caribbean}.

The game creation process should be collaborative, so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the setting and the PCs as a group.
It is good to start with a very broad definition of the setting and then build
PCs, using their creation to find out more details of the setting.

## Setting

To start, decide what kind of setting you want for your story. Then work
together to write down some aspects. This way, you know everyone is on the
same page about important themes and conflicts. For example:

<!-- TODO: Can we cut this down to Genre, Tech/Magic, Conflicts? -->
<!-- TODO: Point out every game needs a conflict. Are their prescribed aspects
for worlds? Setting and Conflict?-->

**Genre**:

- \aspect{Mega Tokyo After the Bomb Dropped}
- \aspect{Mirror shades, trench coats, hacking, and lots of guns}

**Conflicts**: 

- \aspect{Plucky Rebels Take On A Galaxy-spanning Empire}
- \aspect{An Ancient Evil Once Again Threatens the Realms of Men, Dwarves, and
  Elves} 

**Technology or Magic**: 

- \aspect{High School Where Everyone Has Superpowers}
- \aspect{Cybernetics Let Anyone Improve Themselves for A Price}

Write as many or as few Aspects as you need to define your setting. Everyone
at the table should have a feel for what belongs, and what doesn't. You can
always update these Aspects later in response to changes in the
narrative---even if your scene is already underway!

## Scenes

Your game will take place across a number of scenes that exist within the
larger setting. Just as with your overall setting, each scene will have one or
more Aspects that describes it.

The GM will often create these Aspects as they describe the scene to the
players. Some examples: \aspect{Alien Bar Where The Authorities Dare Not
Tread}, \aspect{Mob's Docks At Midnight}, or \aspect{Ancient Fortification
Surrounded by Orcs}.

Just as with setting Aspects, don't be shy about updating Scene Aspects if the
story calls for it. Remember: aspects are always true! <!-- TODO: I don't
think we've ever said this before.-->
