# Game Creation

Character creation goes hand-in-hand with the world building done during Game
Creation. It should be done collaboratively, and so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the world and the PCs as a group.

## Aspects

Aspects short phrases that describe the in-game world. Aspects allow the
narrative to have mechanical weight.

Aspects help the players communicate with each other about the world.

## Characters

Starting PCs consists of two Aspects---their Concept and Trouble---and a set
of skills. Additionally, all PCs have three Stress Boxes, three Consequences,
and a Refresh of 2.

### Aspects

#### Concept

Creating a PC begins with coming up with their Concept, which is an Aspect
that describes, in broad terms, who the PC is and why they are unique,
exciting people that we care about. Some example high concepts are:
**Backwater Farmboy Looking to Join The Academy**, **Rightful King of Gondor**

<!-- Add examples, perhaps from the example characters? -->

#### Trouble

The PC's second Aspect is their Trouble; it describes the sort of things that
get in the PC's way and make their story interesting. The trouble Aspect
should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to cause the PC
trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in game.  Instead, a
PC's trouble Aspect is a good way for the player to indicate what sort of
problems they would find interesting to deal with.

### Skills

Skills give PCs mechanical weight and allow them to interact with the game
world. PCs begin with one skill at rank +2, and two skills at rank +1. 

### Refresh

A PC's Refresh determines how many Fate Points they start each session with.
PCs begin with a refresh of 2.

### Stress and Consequences

Stress Boxes and Consequences represent how a PC is effected by various forms
of harm. PCs begin with three stress boxes, and three consequences (labeled
Mild, Moderate, and Severe).

### Scenes
