# Skills

## Default Skill List

What follows is our generic list of ten Skills; they cover the basics of what
we think characters will need to do during the course of play.

We _highly_ recommend coming up with your own Skill list. By doing so, you
are able to place emphasis on the actions that will be important in your game.
For example, if your campaign is based around a group of fighter pilots on the
edge of the galaxy, you might want to add a _Piloting_ skill. If instead the
characters are paranormal investigators, you might want to break _Insight_
into _Knowledge_ and _Search_ as these actions will be used a lot. In the end,
the skill list you use will heavily influence the action that happens in your
game.

<!-- In general is it that we want skills to be more equal? If you're playing
a fighter pilot game and flying is agility, then agility is going to be rolled
**ALL THE TIME**, where as if you split it into Dexterity and Dog Fighting,
you have a hope of some more skill balance. -->
