Fate Core starts by going through the character sheet to introduce the ideas
of aspects, skills, etc. For a short document, it's probably better to jump
right in. Possible entry points:

- Character creation. Nest aspects and skills under.
- Aspects. They are always true! Short improvised statements.
- Skills. These are the numbers you use to roll dice.

PCs should be assumed to be competent though, a `Master swordsman` does not
role to see if he defeats the henchmen---of course he would---he roles to see
if he does it before the villain escapes, or without alerting the other
guards. <!-- I don't like this here, but I don't know where else it would go
an I think it's an important point. Maybe it goes in the place when we talk
about "aspects are true"? -->
