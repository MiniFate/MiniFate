# Actions

## The Outcomes 

- **Fail**: If your roll totals less than the opposition's, you fail. You
  don't achieve your goal and things, in general, should get worse for your
  character.
- **Succeed At Cost**: If your roll is equal to the opposition's, you succeed
  at cost. This means you achieve your goal, but lose something in the
  process, or that you get almost what you wanted, but not quite.
- **Succeed**: If your roll is greater than your opponent's, you succeed. You
  achieve your goal.
- **Succeed With Style**: If your roll is greater than your opponent's by 3 or
  more, you succeed with style. You achieve your goals _and_ you create an
  aspect that is favorable to you.
