# Aspects and Fate Points

## Aspects

An Aspect is a short phrase written about the in-game world by a player or the
GM. Some Aspects are attached to characters, allowing the player or GM to
express in their own words what makes the character unique and interesting.
Other Aspects refer to the world around the characters, or the story taking
place in it; an Aspect can be a detail within the current scene, a summary of
the overarching plot arc, or literally any other phrase that the players or GM
find pertinent.

Aspects are the heart and soul of MiniFate. They have four roles, each of
which is crucial to the game (and each of which will be explained in detail
later):

- Aspects can be invoked for bonuses on rolls. For example, if a roll goes
  poorly while **EXAMPLE ROGUE** is trying to sneak past some guards,
  **HE/SHE** could pay a fate point to invoke **Dark and Stormy Night** to
  improve the roll. It makes sense that the dark would work to **HIS/HER**
  advantage.
- Aspects can be compelled to create engaging plot twists and complications.
  For example, **blah blah blah**.
- Aspects are always true, so they govern the sorts of play that make sense.
  For example, if **SAMPLE** is **Grappled**, it wouldn't make sense for
  **HIM/HER** to run away, fire an arrow, or do anything else that requires
  free movement until **HE/SHE** escaped the grapple.
- Aspects can be used to flavor character skills and rolls, called
  Aspect-Based Narration. The Shoot skill applies to all manner of
  projectiles, from arrows to javelins to magic attacks. **SAMPLE
  SORCERESS**'s Aspect **PYROMANCER Aspect** indicates that when she rolls
  Shoot, she's probably doing so to throw a fireball... and that she probably
  can't make any Shoot rolls if her fire magic is somehow suppressed.

Each character is created with two Aspects (see the character creation rules
in chapter **X**). The player can use these Aspects to showcase whatever they
feel is important about their character, such as their job (**Deep-Woods
Lumberjack**), something important they carry (**Crown of a Diposed King**),
what motivates them (**Lord Kellett Will Pay for the Greywood Massacre**), the
sort of trouble they tend to get into (**Owes a Lot to the Wrong People**),
and so on. These Aspects serve to introduce the character to the rest of the
table. Characters gain more Aspects as time goes on, in order to illustrate
their growth and the new relationships they form (as discussed in the
character advancement rules in chapter **Y**).  <!--TODO: Can they really
showcase whatever they want at creation if we have a high concept and trouble
aspect?-->

### Story Aspects

Any Aspect not attached to a character is a story Aspect. Like character
Aspects, story Aspects are always true; unlike those Aspects, story Aspects
are dynamic. Creating an effect in the fiction is synonymous with creating a
story Aspect. Reversing that effect destroys the Aspect.

Story Aspects can be introduced by the GM to help set a scene; for example, it
may bear noting that **It's Raining Hard** or that **Everyone Seems On-Edge**.
They can also be created as a result of skill rolls during gameplay. Quenching
a campfire can create **Pitch Blackness**; wrestling someone to the ground
creates **Grappled**.

The destruction of Aspects is similar. They can be destroyed manually by
rolling; if a roll is made to break a grapple, the **Grappled** Aspect is
destroyed. Story Aspects also are destroyed when they are no longer relevant,
or no longer make sense. When the sun rises, **Pitch Blackness** is destroyed.

### Hidden Aspects

Most character and story Aspects are visible to everyone at the table, but not
all of them. The GM may choose to keep some Aspects hidden.  Obvious examples
include monster weaknesses (**Missing Scale Over His Heart**), imminent
ambushes (**Those Bushes Look Suspiciously Like Orcs**), and the schemes and
motivations of NPCs (**Lord Grofhurst Is My Unknowing Puppet**). Hidden
Aspects serve more or less as the GM's notes; if invoked or compelled, they
must be revealed to everyone.

Sometimes the story revolves around an NPC with a secret or a hidden
motivation that should be revealed slowly. In this case, it is often best to
start with slightly suspicious public Aspects and then change them as the
players catch on. For example, Lord Kellett is a Dragon masquerading as the
human general of the Empire's armies. He could start with an Aspect like
**Strong as Ten Men** which indicates his incredible strength, but is poetic
enough to be overlooked. Later, as he performs more and more superhuman feats,
his Aspect might change to **No Man Is As Strong**. Finally, when the players
discover his true nature, his aspect could be replaced with **Strength of a
Dragon**.

## Fate Points

Fate Points are a currency that can be spent to assert narrative control
over the game. Both the players and the GM have pools of Fate Points available
to use. Players start each session with a number of Fate Points equal to their
character's Refresh, GMs start each scene with as many Fate Points as there
are PCs.

Fate Points are spent to do one of two things:

1. Invoke an Aspect
2. Create an Aspect

### Invoking Aspects

### Creating Aspects

Creating Aspects gives the Players a chance to narrate a story detail.
