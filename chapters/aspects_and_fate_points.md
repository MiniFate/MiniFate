# Aspects and Fate Points

## Aspects

_Aspects_ are the heart and soul of MiniFate; they give it its power while
maintaining its elegance. An Aspect is, at its simplest, just a short phrase
that describes something important to the narrative. Aspects can be used to
indicate something about the weather or the current location. They can tell
you something about a character's physical nature, personality, or their items
and equipment. They can even be used for large-scale issues like the current
political climate or for small-scale issues like <!--TODO: Like what!?-->. In
short, if there is something that matters to the story, I can (and should) be
described with an Aspect.

Aspects allow things that are important in the narrative to have mechanical
effect on the game through [Fate Points][].

We have scattered example Aspects throughout this book to help you get an idea
of the broad range of things Aspects can cover, and the way to write engaging,
interesting Aspects.

## Fate Points

_Fate Points_ are a currency that can be spent to assert narrative control
over the game. Both the players and the GM have pools of Fate Points available
to use. Players start each session with a number of Fate Points equal to their
character's _Refresh_, GMs start each scene with as many Fate Points as there
are PCs.

Fate Points are spent to do one of two things:

1. Invoke an Aspect
2. Create an Aspect

### Invoking Aspects

### Creating Aspects

Creating Aspects gives the Players a chance to narrate a story detail.
