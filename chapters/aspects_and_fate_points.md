# Aspects and Fate Points

_Aspects_ are the heart and soul of Minifate. They are simply descriptions of
the in-game world that serve to indicate what exactly in the fiction is
important to the story. They might describe the surroundings (**Crumbling,
Rain-slicked Cliff**), the personality of one of the characters (**There is
still good in him**), the overall issues of the world (**The one ring must be
destroyed**), objects or items (** **), or anything else of narrative import.
