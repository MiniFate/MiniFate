# Character Creation

Character creation goes hand-in-hand with the world building done during Game
Creation. It should be done collaboratively, and so it is often best to set
aside the first session in order to design the world and the characters as a
group.

Starting characters consists of two _Aspects_---their _High Concept_ and
_Trouble_---and a set of skills. Additionally, all characters have three
_Stress Boxes_, three _Consequences_, and a _Refresh_ of 2.

## High Concept

Creating a character begins with coming up with their _High Concept_, which is
an _Aspect_ that describes, in broad terms, who the character is and why they
are unique, exciting people that we care about. Some example high concepts
are: **Backwater Farmboy Looking to Join The Academy**, **Rightful King of
Gondor**

<!-- Add examples, perhaps from the example characters? -->

## Trouble

The character's second _Aspect_ is their _Trouble_; it describes the sort of
things that get in the character's way and make their story interesting. The
trouble aspect should not necessarily be the thing that is most likely to
cause the character trouble, especially if it would be boring to deal with in
game.  Instead, a character's trouble aspect is a good way for the player to
indicate what sort of problems they would find interesting to deal with.

## Skills 

_Skills_ give characters mechanical weight and allow them to interact with the
game world. Characters begin with one skill at rank +2, and two skills at rank
+1.

## Refresh

A character's _Refresh_ determines how many _Fate Points_ they start each
session with.  Characters begin with a refresh of 2.

## Stress and Consequences

_Stress Boxes_ and _Consequences_ represent how a character is effected by
various forms of harm. Characters begin with three stress boxes, and three
consequences (labeled _Mild_, _Moderate_, and _Severe_).
