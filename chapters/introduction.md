# Introduction

**MiniFate** is a tabletop roleplaying game based on [Evil Hat's Fate
Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/). Like Fate Core it is a simple
system designed to enable collaborative play and story telling.

## An Introduction to Roleplaying

MiniFate is played with one game master (**GM**) and one or more **players**.
Each player plays the role of a player character (**PC**) which they create as
the game begins. The GM designs and plays the role of the world around the
PCs, including its cast of non-player characters (**NPCs**), including
everything from elvish royalty to rival adventurers or hideous dungeon
monsters.

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of
the PCs. They could tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at
bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization. It could be a story of
exploration, where the PCs venture into long-forgotten tombs in search of
treasure. It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs take
advantage of instability to consolidate power.

The story is played out scene by scene. The GM opens with a quick description;
from there, play proceeds conversationally as the players and the GM improvise
back and forth. Players may speak as their PCs and describe their actions,
while the GM illustrates how the NPCs and environment respond. Players may
also ask the GM for specific details to help them immerse themselves in the
PCs' surroundings.

Play is punctuated by die rolls, which mediate the divide between player and
PC; PC choices are made by the players while the success of PC actions is
judged by dice. That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to
barter with while the dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings
true. This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses while
still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs however they like.

The pages that follow explain how and when to roll the dice, but above all
MiniFate is a social game. As such, the most important element is
communication. The players and the GM are not opponents (even though the PCs
and NPCs may well be enemies). Everyone has the same goals: telling a good
story and having a good time. If anyone is unsatisfied in either respect, play
should be put on hold to address the issue.

## Materials

MiniFate, like most tabletop roleplaying games, requires pens to write with
and paper to record your character on, a set of Fate dice (sometimes called
Fudge dice), and some tokens to represent Fate points.

Your Character sheet is where you record all the information needed to play
your character in MiniFate. It includes their name, Aspects, Skills,
Stress Boxes, and Consequences. As your character grows throughout the
course of their adventures, their character sheet will change to reflect who
they have become.  <!-- TODO: The previous sentence needs updating. -->

Fate Dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six sided dice marked with "-1"
on two sides, "0" on two sides, and "+1" on two sides. You will need four of
them because every roll in MiniFate uses four dice. In order to keep things
moving quickly, it is best to have one set of dice for each player.

Tokens are useful for keeping track of Fate points. Although in practice
Fate points can be tracked by making tick marks on your character sheet, it
is far more satisfying to have something physical to pass back and forth.
Pokers chips work well, but so do glass beads, or even all those polyhedral
dice you don't need in Fate.
