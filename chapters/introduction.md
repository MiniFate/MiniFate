# Introduction

## Materials

MiniFate, like most tabletop roleplaying games, requires pens to write with
and paper to record your character on, a set of Fate dice (sometimes called
Fudge dice), and some tokens to represent Fate points.

Your _Character sheet_ is where you record all the information needed to play
your character in MiniFate. It includes their name, _Aspects_, _Skills_,
_Stress Boxes_, and _Consequences_. As your character grows throughout the
course of their adventures, their character sheet will change to reflect who
they have become.  <!-- TODO: The previous sentence needs updating. -->

_Fate Dice_ (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six sided dice marked with "-1"
on two sides, "0" on two sides, and "+1" on two sides. You will need four of
them because every roll in MiniFate uses four dice. In order to keep things
moving quickly, it is best to have one set of dice for each player.

_Tokens_ are useful for keeping track of _Fate points_. Although in practice
_Fate points_ can be tracked by making tick marks on your character sheet, it
is far more satisfying to have something physical to pass back and forth.
Pokers chips work well, but so do glass beads, or even all those polyhedral
dice you don't need in Fate.
