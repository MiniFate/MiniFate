# Actions

Most of the time, when a player narrates their PC's actions, the GM should
just allow them to succeed without rolling any dice.  There is no need to look
to the rules to determine if a PC can walk across the street, drive to work,
or find their local coffee shop, just assume that they do and get on with the
game.

The only time when a roll is warranted is when both success _and_ failure lead
to interesting narrative outcomes. While you wouldn't roll to walk across the
street, you would roll <!--TODO: Example HERE -->.

When it does come time to roll dice, you do so as follows

- Pick the most appropriate skill for the action.
- Roll four Fate dice.
- Add the dice together.
- Add your skill rating to the total.
- Decide if you are going to invoke Aspects, and if so re-roll the dice or add
  +2. You may invoke multiple Aspects.

After rolling and adding up all the dice and bonuses, the resulting number is
compared to the opposition's number. The difference between your number and
theirs is the number of Shifts you get, which is used to determine the outcome
of the roll.

## Opposition

When making a roll, the result is compared to the opposition's number. This
opposition might be active, like another PC or NPC, or it could be passive.

Active opposition is used when a character, or something being treated like a
character, is opposing the action. In this case, the opposing character picks
the most appropriate skill for opposing the action and then rolls four Fate
dice as described above. The two rolls are then compared.

> Naka is fleeing from a bounty hunter on the **Mean Streets of Three
> Bridges**. She makes an _Agility_ roll opposed by the hunter's _Agility_ to
> try to escape. She rolls a -2 and adds her _Agility_ rating of +1 for a
> total of -1. The bounty hunter rolls a +2 and adds his _Agility_ rating of 0
> for a total of 2, beating Naka by 3 shifts! Naka pays a Fate point to invoke
> the **Mean Streets of Three Bridges**, saying that the bounty hunter would
> be slowed as he was accosted by street urchins. She uses the invoke to
> re-roll the dice and scores a +2, which gives her a total of +3 when her
> _Agility_ is added, beating the bounty hunter by 1 shift, and allowing her
> to escape!

Passive opposition is used when there is no PC or NPC actively opposing the
action, but the action itself is prone to interesting failure anyway. In this
case a target number is set by looking at the aspects active in the scene; for
each aspect that might make the action more difficult, add +2 to the target
difficulty. If there are no aspects indicating that the task should be
difficult, then the target difficulty is just 0 (and you should reconsider
rolling at all; if there are no aspects that interact with the action, the
action probably isn't important enough to the story to make rolling
worthwhile). The result of the roll is then compared to the target number.

> Dolores has snuck into the basement of Father Liam's church and discovered
> an **Ancient Tome in a Forgotten Toungue**. She attempts to decipher it in
> the hope that it will reveal the time and place where Liam and his followers
> plan to summon an Old God. Because there is only the one aspect indicating
> that this action would be difficult, the GM sets the target number to 2.
> Dolores makes an _Insight_ roll and gets a 1. She has no _Insight_ rating
> and so doesn't add anything to roll. Further, there are no applicable
> Aspects, so she can't modify the roll. Since she didn't meet the target
> number, she fails. The GM tells her she is unable to read it, but that she
> thinks she's seen similar writings on a book in the used bookstore
> downtown...

## The Outcomes

- **Fail**: If your roll totals less than the opposition's, you fail. You
  don't achieve your goal and things, in general, should get worse for your
  character.
- **Succeed At Cost**: If your roll is equal to the opposition's, you succeed
  at cost. This means you achieve your goal, but lose something in the
  process, or that you get almost what you wanted, but not quite.
- **Succeed**: If your roll is greater than your opponent's, you succeed. You
  achieve your goal.
- **Succeed With Style**: If your roll is greater than your opponent's by 3 or
  more, you succeed with style. You achieve your goals _and_ you create an
  aspect that is favorable to you.
