# Outline

## Skills

* Skills take values of 0, +1, +2, ...
* Must maintain a pyramid shape.
* Start at +2.

## Aspects

Aspects cover *everything* that isn't covered by skills. If there is something
in the narrative that should add weight to the action, then it is an aspect
that can be invoked (or simply taken into account when narrating results).

## Fate points

Characters start with 2 refresh, which is the number of fate points they start
each session will.

## Advancement

* **Minor**: After every session: Rearrange any number of skills, change any
  aspects, add +1 to a skill or to your refresh, or add a new aspect.
* **Major**: After a major story arc is resolved: Your skill cap goes up +1
  and you may rearrange any skills and change any aspects.

## Stress and Consequences

Everyone has one stress track with 3 boxes.

There are three consequences slots:
* **Minor**: Absorbs 2, clears after a session
* **Major**: Absorbs 4, clears after several sessions 
* **Severe**: Absorbs 6, clears after a Major story line is resolved.
