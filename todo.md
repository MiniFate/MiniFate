# TODO

## Introduction

- Write an "Aspects are awesome" introduction

- Write a bit about building the world as you build the characters

## Character Creation

- Use aspects from the example characters
- Explain the pyramid?
- Expand the concept and trouble to make the breadth allowed clear

## Example PCs

- Figure out a setting for Dolores
    - Write intro for Dolores

## Skills

- Does the pyramid go here?
- Optimize the names of the skills

- Are these skills orthogonal enough

## Aspects and Fate Points

### Aspects

Mostly good, some editing maybe?

- Add a bit on each of our four cases for aspects.

### Fate Points

- How to compel

## Actions

- Write a combat section
- Write an out-of-combat section

## NPCs

I think this is in pretty good shape. Maybe more examples.
