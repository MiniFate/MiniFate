# TODO

## Introduction

- Write an "Aspects are awesome" introduction
- Go over the Materials section

## How to play RPGs

We have a bit in the intro, do we need a chapter? If so, steal from
Bloodlines

## Game Creation

- Write a bit about joint world building
- Write a bit about building the world as you build the characters
- Write a bit about playing to find out about the world

## Character Creation

- Use aspects from the example characters
- Explain the pyramid?
- Expand the concept and trouble to make the breadth allowed clear

## Example PCs

- Figure out a setting for Dolores
    - Write intro for Dolores

## Skills

- Does the pyramid go here?
- Optimize the names of the skills
- Optimize the verbs
- Are these skills orthogonal enough 
- Write a little more about each skill?

## Aspects and Fate Points

### Aspects

Mostly good, some editing maybe?

- Add a bit on each of our four cases for aspects.

### Fate Points

- How to compel

## Actions

Does this go in the skills chapter?

- Write a combat section
- Write an out-of-combat section
- Symmetrize these

## NPCs

I think this is in pretty good shape. Maybe more examples.

## Essays

- Magic and shapeshifting with Aspect-based Narration
- Weapons, guns, ammunition
- Gold, loot, and items with aspects
- Vehicles and mounts with aspects
- Animal companions with aspects
